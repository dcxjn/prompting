USER: 
    Observe the given image and its details.
    Provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how a human would complete the task of: open the door.
    Link each instruction to an observation in the image in this format: Observation - Instruction.
    
ASSISTANT: Observation - The door is currently closed.
Instruction - To open the door, you would need to find the handle or lever that is used to open the door.

Observation - The handle is located on the right side of the door.
Instruction - To open the door, you would need to grasp the handle and pull it towards you.

Observation - The door has a window on the left side.
Instruction - Before opening the door, you might want to check if there are any signs or indications that the door is locked or if there are any security measures in place.

Observation - There are no visible signs or indications that the door is locked or there are any security measures in place.
Instruction - With the handle in hand, you can now open the door by pulling it towards you.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - Once the door is open, you can proceed into the room or area beyond.

USER: 
    Imagine you are in control of a robotic arm with the following commands: 
    1. move_to(x, y)
    2. grab(object)
    3. release(object)
    4. push(object)
    5. pull(object)
    6. rotate(angle)
   Given the human instructions you have generated, provide a guide on how the robot would complete the task.
    
ASSISTANT: Observation - The door is currently closed.
Instruction - To open the door, you would need to find the handle or lever that is used to open the door.

Observation - The handle is located on the right side of the door.
Instruction - To open the door, you would need to program the robotic arm to move towards the handle and grab it.

Observation - The door has a window on the left side.
Instruction - Before opening the door, you might want to check if there are any signs or indications that the door is locked or if there are any security measures in place.

Observation - There are no visible signs or indications that the door is locked or there are any security measures in place.
Instruction - With the handle in hand, you can now program the robotic arm to move the handle towards the open position.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - Once the door is open, you can program the robotic arm to release the handle.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - With the door open, you can program the robotic arm to move the object you want to move into the room or area beyond.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - Once the object is in the desired location, you can program the robotic arm to release the object.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - With the door open, you can program the robotic arm to rotate the object to the desired angle.

Observation - The door is now open.
Instruction - Once the object is rotated to the desired angle, you can program the robotic arm to push or pull the object as needed.

Please note that these instructions are based on the given human instructions and the observations made in the image. The actual commands and actions required for a robotic arm would depend on the specific capabilities and programming of the robotic arm.

USER: 
    By referencing an observation in the image, ensure each instruction is accurate. Do not make assumptions.
    Check that each instruction is logical.
