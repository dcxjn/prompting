USER: 
    Imagine you are in control of a robotic arm with the following commands: 
    1. move_to(x, y)
    2. grab(object)
    3. release(object)
    4. push(object)
    5. pull(object)
    6. rotate(angle)
   Given the human instructions you have generated, provide a guide on how the robot would complete the task.
    
ASSISTANT: To complete the task of opening the door, the robotic arm would need to follow these steps:

1. move_to(0, 0) - This command would position the arm at the starting point, which is the current position of the door.

2. grab(door) - This command would grab the door using the arm's gripper.

3. rotate(90 degrees) - This command would rotate the arm 90 degrees to the right, positioning it to open the door.

4. push(door) - This command would push the door open.

5. release(door) - This command would release the door from the arm's gripper.

6. move_to(0, 0) - This command would move the arm back to its starting position.

7. rotate(90 degrees) - This command would rotate the arm 90 degrees to the left, positioning it back to its starting point.

8. move_to(0, 0) - This command would move the arm back to its starting position.

Please note that these commands are based on the assumption that the arm has a gripper and can rotate. The actual commands may vary depending on the capabilities of the robotic arm.
