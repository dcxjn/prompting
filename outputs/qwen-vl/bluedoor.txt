2. Grab the door handle.
   Observation - The robotic arm has successfully grabbed the door handle.
   Instruction - Use the grab() command to grab the door handle.

3. Rotate the door handle clockwise to unlock the door.
   Observation - The door handle is in the unlocked position.
   Instruction - Use the rotate() command to rotate the door handle clockwise.

4. Push the door to open it.
   Observation - The door is still closed.
   Instruction - Use the push() command to push the door open.

5. Once the door is open, release the door handle.
   Observation - The door is now open.
   Instruction - Use the release() command to release the door handle.

6. Pull the door to close it.
   Observation - The door is still open.
   Instruction - Use the pull() command to pull the door closed.
