The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Location of the Handle**: The handle is located on the right side of the door when facing it, which is typical for push doors. In pull doors, the handle is usually on the left side.

2. **Design of the Door**: Push doors often have a wider door frame and a larger door opening to accommodate the hand to push against. The door in the image has a relatively narrow frame and a standard-sized door opening, which is characteristic of push doors.

3. **Hinge Mechanism**: Push doors usually have their hinges on the side opposite the handle, allowing the door to swing outward when pushed. The visible hinge mechanism in the image is on the left side, which is consistent with a push door design.

4. **Locking Mechanism**: Push doors often have a lever-style handle that allows the door to be opened from the inside to let someone in. The handle on the right side of the door in the image is consistent with this type of locking mechanism.

5. **Overall Aesthetics**: The door's design, with its vertical panels and simple handle, is also indicative of a push door style.

So, if you are facing the image, this is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round, metal doorknocker. Typically, to open a door with a doorknocker like this, you would push or tap it gently. However, the exact mechanism might vary depending on the door's design and the type of doorknocker.
