The door in the image is a pull door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: The handle is located on the right side of the door, which is typical for pull doors. In pull doors, the handle is usually on the side that you pull the door towards you.

2. **Hinge Location**: The hinge is not visible in the image, but if it were, it would typically be located on the side opposite the handle, which is consistent with the pull mechanism. Since the handle is on the right, the hinge would likely be on the left side, out of view.

3. **Design**: Pull doors often have a wider opening and are designed to swing outwards from the wall, which is also consistent with the orientation of the door and its handle in the image.

4. **Frame**: The door frame is wider on the side where the handle is located, which is another indication that it's a pull door. The frame is designed to accommodate the door's swing and the handle's placement.

5. **Usage**: Pull doors are commonly used for entrances to garages, workshops, or other areas where it's more practical to pull the door open rather than push it open.

Based on these observations, the door in the image is a pull door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It is a long, horizontal bar handle. To open the door, you would typically grip the handle with one hand and turn it clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's hinge mechanism. If you're unsure which way to turn, you can look for a door handle indicator or a small sign near the handle that usually shows which way to turn to open the door.
