The door you are facing appears to be an automatic sliding door. Here's how you can determine this:

1. **Design**: The door has a horizontal bar at the top, which is typical of automatic sliding doors. This bar is used to detect the presence of an object or person to prevent the door from closing automatically.

2. **Mechanism**: There is no visible handle or lever on the door, which is common for automatic sliding doors. Instead, there is a sensor mechanism that operates the door.

3. **Operation**: The door is wide open, and there is no visible mechanism to manually push or pull it. It seems to be in a state of rest, waiting for a signal to either open or close.

4. **Position**: The door is aligned with the floor, which is typical for sliding doors. It is not hinged or pivoted like a push or pull door.

5. **Functionality**: The door is set within a frame, which is common for sliding doors. There is no visible hinge or pivot point visible from this angle.

6. **Safety**: The door has a small sign at the bottom indicating it is an automatic sliding door, which is a safety feature to prevent accidents.

Based on these observations, it is clear that this is an automatic sliding door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a push handle, so you would push it to open the door.
