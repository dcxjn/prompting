The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Door Handle Position**: The door handle is located on the right side of the door when facing it, which is typical for push doors. In pull doors, the handle is usually on the left side.

2. **Door Design**: Push doors often have a wider door opening to accommodate the hand to push against, while pull doors may have a smaller opening to allow for easier pulling.

3. **Door Frame**: The door frame is wider on the side where the handle is located, which is a common design for push doors to provide more space for the hand to push against.

4. **Door Hinges**: Although not visible in the image, push doors typically have hinges located closer to the center of the door, allowing for a wider swing to accommodate the hand pushing from the side.

5. **Door Opening**: The door appears to open outwards from the wall, which is consistent with the opening mechanism of a push door.

6. **Room Layout**: The room layout, with the door opening into the room and not away from it, also suggests that this is a push door.

7. **Doorknob Position**: The doorknob is on the right side, which is standard for push doors.

8. **Room Functionality**: The door leads into a room that doesn't seem to require the user to pull it open, such as a bedroom or a closet, which are common places for push doors.

Based on these observations, the door in the image is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round doorknob. To open the door, you would typically turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation and the type of hinge used. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to test it gently before applying any force.
