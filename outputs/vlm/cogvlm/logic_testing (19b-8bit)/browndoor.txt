Based on the image provided, it appears to be a push door. Here's how you can determine this:

1. **Door Handle Position**: The door handle is on the right side of the door when facing it. Typically, push doors have the handle on the right side, while pull doors have the handle on the left side.

2. **Door Alignment**: The door is aligned perpendicular to the wall, which is common for push doors. Pull doors are often aligned at a slight angle to the wall.

3. **Door Frame**: The door frame is wider on the side where the handle is located, which is a common design for push doors to accommodate the handle's width.

4. **Door Opening**: The door opens inward, which is typical for push doors. Pull doors usually open outward.

5. **Room Layout**: The room layout, where the door opens into a hallway or another room, also suggests it's a push door.

6. **Doorknob Position**: The doorknob is on the right side, which is standard for push doors.

Considering these observations, it is likely that this is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round doorknob. To open the door, you would typically turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation and the type of hinge used. If you can't turn it, you might need to check if it's locked and use the key if provided.
