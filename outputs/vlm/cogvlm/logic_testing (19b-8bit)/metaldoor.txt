The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: The handle is located on the right side of the door when facing it, which is typical for push doors. In pull doors, the handle is usually on the left side.

2. **Hinge Location**: The hinge is visible on the left side of the door, which is consistent with push doors where the door swings to the right when pushed.

3. **Door Design**: The door has a horizontal bar handle, which is a common design for push doors. Pull doors often have vertical or round handles.

4. **Frame Design**: The frame's structure, with the door's weight supported on the right side, also suggests it's a push door.

5. **Door Opening Direction**: The door is set into the wall, opening to the right when pushed, which is a common installation direction for push doors.

6. **Door Locking Mechanism**: Although not visible in the image, push doors typically have a mechanism that allows the door to be locked from the inside, which is consistent with the handle's position on the right side.

7. **Door's Position**: The door is set into the wall, opening to the right when pushed, which is a common installation direction for push doors.

8. **Door's Operation**: The door's operation, where it opens to the right when pushed, is also indicative of it being a push door.

Therefore, based on these observations, the door in the image is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle. To open the door, you would typically push the lever in the direction you want to open the door, rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise as needed.
