The door in the image appears to be a sliding door, which is typically opened by moving it horizontally to the side rather than vertically up and down like a push or pull door. The presence of a horizontal metal track and handle on the right side of the door suggests this functionality.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a horizontal bar handle. Typically, to open such a door, you would push it inwards while turning the handle to the right or left, depending on the door's orientation.
