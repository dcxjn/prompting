The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: The handle is on the right side of the door when facing it. Push doors typically have the handle on the right side, while pull doors have the handle on the left side.

2. **Door Design**: Push doors are often designed with a wider opening to allow for easier passage, and they may have a slight overhang on the right side to provide a larger opening when pushing. The door in the image has a wider opening on the right side, which is a common feature of push doors.

3. **Frame**: The frame of the door is wider on the right side, which is another indication that it's a push door.

4. **Hinge**: The hinge is usually located on the left side of the door, which is consistent with the handle's position on the right side, suggesting it's a push door.

5. **Usage**: Push doors are commonly found in settings where space is at a premium, such as in hallways or narrow corridors, where it's more practical to push open rather than pull open.

6. **Design Aesthetics**: Push doors are often chosen for their clean and streamlined appearance, which can be seen in the design of the door in the image.

7. **Functionality**: Push doors are typically used in areas where there is a need for quick and easy access, such as entrances to homes or offices.

8. **Safety**: Push doors can be safer in certain situations, as they don't require the user to turn their back to the door to open it, which can be beneficial in areas with potential hazards.

Based on these observations, the door in the image is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round, white doorknob. To open the door, you would typically turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation and the type of hinge used. If you're unsure, it's always a good idea to check with the homeowner or look for a sign indicating the direction of opening.
