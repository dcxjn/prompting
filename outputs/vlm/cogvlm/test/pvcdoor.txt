The door in the image is a folding accordion door. It is neither a push nor a pull door. Instead, it operates by folding inwards to create a clear passage when opened. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Operation Mechanism**: Folding accordion doors have a unique hinge system that allows them to fold inwards. The hinges are typically located at the top of each door panel, and they connect to a central rail or track system.

2. **Opening**: When the door is opened, the panels slide along the rail, folding inwards towards the center. This creates a wide, clear passage that allows for easy movement through the door.

3. **Closing**: To close the door, the panels are pushed back towards the outer edges, and they lock into place at the hinges. This ensures that the door remains securely closed.

4. **Advantages**: Folding accordion doors offer several advantages:
   - **Space-Saving**: They can open wide to create a spacious passage without taking up much room, making them ideal for areas with limited space.
   - **Privacy**: They can be closed to provide privacy while still allowing light to pass through.
   - **Aesthetic Appeal**: They add a modern and elegant touch to interior design.
   - **Easy to Clean**: The panels can be easily wiped down, making them a good choice for areas prone to dust or spills.

5. **Maintenance**: While they are relatively easy to clean, it's important to ensure that the hinges and rail system are regularly checked and maintained to ensure smooth operation and longevity.

6. **Safety**: They can be secured with locks or deadbolts for added safety.

7. **Cost**: They can be more expensive than traditional doors, but they offer a unique design and functionality that can justify the cost for some homeowners.
