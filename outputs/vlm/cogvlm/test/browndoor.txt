The image does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the door is push or pull. However, the visible hinge on the right side suggests it could be a push door, as the hinge is typically located on the side opposite to where the door is pushed open.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round doorknob. To open the door, you would typically turn the knob clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation and the type of hinge used. If you can't turn it, you might need to check if it's locked and use the key if provided.
