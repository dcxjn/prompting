The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can tell:

1. **Location of the Handle**: Push doors typically have the handle located on the side, allowing for easier pushing from the outside. In this image, the handle is on the right side, which is the typical location for a push door.

2. **Design of the Door**: Push doors often have a wider door opening to accommodate the hand and arm movement needed to push the door open. The door in the image has a relatively wide opening, which is characteristic of push doors.

3. **Lack of a Deadbolt**: Push doors usually do not have a deadbolt mechanism on the inside, as it would hinder the ease of opening from the inside. In this image, there is no visible deadbolt on the inside of the door.

4. **Hinge Placement**: The hinge is usually located on the inside of the door, opposite the handle. In this image, the hinge is on the left side, which is consistent with the handle's placement on the right, indicating it's a push door.

5. **Door Design**: Push doors often have a more simplistic design, as they don't require the additional security features that pull doors might have. The door in the image has a straightforward design without any visible security features like a peephole or a security camera.

6. **Doorknob Shape**: Push doors often have a round or oval-shaped doorknob, which allows for easier grip and movement. The doorknob in the image is round, which is typical for push doors.

7. **Floor Mat**: Push doors often have a mat placed in front to give visitors a place to step onto before pushing the door open. In this image, there is a mat in front of the door, which is a common feature for push doors.

Based on these observations, the door in the image is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a round, metal doorknocker. Typically, to open a door with a doorknocker like this, you would push or tap it gently. However, the exact mechanism might vary depending on the door's design and the type of doorknocker.
