The door in the image is a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: There is a handle on the right side of the door, which is typical for push doors. Pull doors usually have the handle on the inside, closer to the person entering.

2. **Door Design**: The door is wider than the handle, which is a common design for push doors. Pull doors often have the handle centered or closer to the opening to allow for easier pulling.

3. **Frame**: The door frame is wider than the handle, further indicating that it's designed to be pushed open.

4. **Viewing Angle**: When looking at the door from the outside, the handle is clearly visible on the right side, suggesting it's meant to be pushed from the right side.

5. **Functionality**: Push doors are typically used in areas where space is at a premium, and it's more efficient to push the door open rather than pull it.

6. **Safety**: Push doors can be safer in areas with high foot traffic, as they don't swing outwards and potentially hit people.

7. **Maintenance**: Push doors are often easier to maintain and clean, as there's no mechanism to get stuck or jammed like a pull door might.

Based on these observations, it's clear that the door is designed to be pushed open.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle. To open the door, you would typically push the lever to the side, allowing the door to swing open.
