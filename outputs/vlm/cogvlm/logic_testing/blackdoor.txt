The door in the image appears to be a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: The handle is located on the right side of the door, which is typical for push doors. In push doors, the handle is usually on the side that you push the door open from.

2. **Locking Mechanism**: Although the lock is not entirely visible, the positioning of the handle and the visible part of the lock suggest it's a push door. Pull doors usually have the handle on the inside, opposite the direction of opening, and the lock is often located closer to the center of the door.

3. **Frame Design**: The door frame is wider on the side where the handle is located, which is a common design for push doors to provide more space for the hand to grip and push the door open.

4. **Door Opening Direction**: The door is set into the wall, which is a common installation method for push doors. Pull doors are often set outwards from the wall.

5. **Viewing Angle**: When looking at the image, the door appears to open towards the viewer, which is consistent with the orientation of a push door.

Based on these observations, it's likely that this is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It is a long, horizontal bar handle. To open the door, you would typically grip the handle with one hand and turn it clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's hinge mechanism. If you're unsure which way to turn, you can look for a door handle indicator or a small sign near the handle that usually shows which way to turn to open the door.
