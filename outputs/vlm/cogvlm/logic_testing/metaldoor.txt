The door in the image appears to be a push door. Here's how you can determine that:

1. **Handle Position**: The handle is located on the right side of the door when facing it, which is typical for push doors. In pull doors, the handle is usually on the left side.

2. **Hinge Location**: The hinge is visible on the left side of the door, which is consistent with push doors where the door swings to the right when pushed.

3. **Door Design**: The door's design, with its full width and the way it opens, also suggests it's meant to be pushed open rather than pulled.

4. **Frame Structure**: The frame structure, which includes the vertical metal bars on the left side, is consistent with push doors that require a wider opening to accommodate the door's swing.

5. **Door Operation**: The door is currently closed, and there's no visible mechanism to pull it open from the visible side. The handle's position and the door's design suggest it's meant to be pushed to open.

Based on these observations, it's likely that this is a push door.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle. To open the door, you would typically push the lever in the direction you want to open the door, rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise as needed.
