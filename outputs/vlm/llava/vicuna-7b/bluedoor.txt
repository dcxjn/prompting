==========

USER: 
    Observe the given image and its details.
    Provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how a human would complete the task of: open the door.
    Link each instruction to an observation in the image in this format: Observation - Instruction.
    
ASSISTANT: Observation - The door is a solid blue color with a white frame.

Instruction - Approach the door and use the handle to open it.

Observation - The handle is located on the right side of the door.

Instruction - Once the door is open, you can see the interior of the house.

Observation - The interior of the house is not visible in the image.

USER: 
    Imagine you are in control of a robotic arm with the following commands: 
    1. move_to(x, y)
    2. grab(object)
    3. release(object)
    4. push(object)
    5. pull(object)
    6. rotate(angle)
   Given the human instructions you have generated, provide a guide on how the robot would complete the task.
