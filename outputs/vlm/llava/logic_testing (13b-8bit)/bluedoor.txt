The door in the image appears to be a push door. This is indicated by the presence of a door handle on the right side of the door, which is typically used for pushing the door open. Pull doors, on the other hand, have handles on the left side of the door for pulling it open.
Yes, the door has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle, which is typically used for doors that are designed to be pushed open. To open the door, you would push the handle downward, which would cause the latch to release and the door to swing open.
