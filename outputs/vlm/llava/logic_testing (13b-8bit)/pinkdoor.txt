The door in the image appears to be a push door. This is indicated by the direction of the hinges, which are on the right side of the door, suggesting that the door would open outward when pushed.
The door in the image has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle, which is typically used for doors that are designed to be pushed open. To open the door, you would push the handle down, which would cause the latch to release and the door to swing open.
