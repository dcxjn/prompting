The image shows a door with a sliding mechanism, which is typically a pull door. This means that to open the door, you would pull it towards you.
The door in the image does not have a visible handle. It appears to be a sliding door, which typically operates by sliding horizontally rather than swinging open like a traditional door. To open a sliding door, you would usually push it to the side to open it. If the door is designed to slide open, you would push it to the left or right, depending on which side the door is designed to open from. If the door is designed to slide open inwardly, you would push it inward. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for the specific door you have to ensure you are opening it correctly and safely.
