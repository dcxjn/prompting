The door in the image appears to be a push door. This is indicated by the direction of the hinges, which are on the right side of the door, suggesting that the door would open outward when pushed. Pull doors, on the other hand, have hinges on the left side of the door, so the door would open inward when pulled.
Yes, the door in the image has a handle. It appears to be a lever-style handle, which is typically used for doors that are designed to be opened by pushing rather than pulling. To open the door, you would push the lever down to unlock the door.
