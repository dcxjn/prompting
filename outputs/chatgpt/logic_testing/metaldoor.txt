The door in the image appears to be a pull door. This is indicated by the presence of a handle on the side facing the viewer. Typically, handles are used to pull doors open. Additionally, the door closer mechanism at the top of the door suggests that it swings outward from the viewer's perspective, further indicating that it is a pull door.
Yes, the door has a handle. The handle is a lever type, which is a horizontal bar that you can push down or pull up to operate the door. To open the door, you would typically push the lever down and then pull or push the door open, depending on the door's swing direction.
