To determine whether you need to push or pull the door to open it, you can look at the position of the hinges and the door handle. In the image, the hinges are on the left side, and the door handle is on the right side. This typically indicates that the door opens towards you, meaning you would need to pull the door to open it.
Yes, the door has a handle. It is a round doorknob. To open the door, you need to turn the doorknob either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's locking mechanism, and then push or pull the door open.
