Identify the door handle: Upon arrival at the door, locate the door handle, which is the circular metal piece with a ring at the top, situated in the center of the door.
Reach for the handle: Using one hand, extend it towards the door handle and grasp it firmly.
Turn the handle: Rotate the handle clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation, to unlock it.

Imagine you are in control of a robotic arm with the following commands: 1. move_to(x, y)
2. grab(object)
3. release(object)
4. push(object)
5. pull(object)
6. rotate(angle)
Given the human instructions you have generated, provide a guide on how the robot would complete the task.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door using the given commands:

Move to the door: move_to(0, 0)
Identify the door handle: grab(door_handle)
Unlock the door: release(door_handle)
Push the door open: push(door, 0.5)
Enter the room: move_to(0.5, 0.5)
Rotate to face the room: rotate(90)
Note: In this guide, door_handle is an object variable representing the door handle, and door is another object variable representing the door. The robot would need to have a map or a way to detect objects to perform these actions accurately.
