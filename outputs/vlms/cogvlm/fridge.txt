Observation - Instruction:

Identify the location of the apples in the refrigerator.
Look for the crisper drawers in the refrigerator where fruits are typically stored.
Open the refrigerator door.
Locate the handle on the right side of the refrigerator door and pull it open.
Locate the crisper drawers.
Inside the refrigerator, you will see multiple shelves. The crisper drawers are usually the drawers at the bottom.
Reach for the apples.
Once you locate the crisper drawers, you can pull them out and reach for the apples stored inside.
Pick up the apple(s).
Choose the apple(s) you want and pick them up.
Close the refrigerator door.
After selecting your apple(s), close the refrigerator door to maintain the freshness of the food inside.

Imagine you are in control of a robotic arm with the following commands: 1. move_to(x, y)
2. grab(object)
3. release(object)
4. push(object)
5. pull(object)
6. rotate(angle)
Given the human instructions you have generated, provide a guide on how the robot would complete the task.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide for the robot to complete the task of getting an apple:

Move to the location of the refrigerator.
Command: move_to(0, 0)
Observation: The refrigerator is located at the origin of the coordinate system.
Open the refrigerator door.
Command: grab(object = "refrigerator door handle")
Observation: The refrigerator door handle is located on the right side of the refrigerator.
Locate the crisper drawers.
Command: move_to(0.5, 0.5)
Observation: The crisper drawers are located approximately 0.5 meters to the right and 0.5 meters down from the origin.
Reach for the apples.
Command: grab(object = "apple")
Observation: The apples are stored inside the crisper drawers.
Pick up the apple(s).
Command: release(object = "apple")
Close the refrigerator door.
Command: push(object = "refrigerator door handle")
This sequence of commands would guide the robotic arm to move to the refrigerator, open it, locate the crisper drawers, pick up an apple, and then close the refrigerator door.
