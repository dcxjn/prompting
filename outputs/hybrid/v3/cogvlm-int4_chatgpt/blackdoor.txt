=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

1. Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
2. Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
3. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
4. Where is the door handle located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the handle?)
5. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
6. Does the door handle need to be turned, pushed, or pulled to open the door?
7. If the handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
8. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
9. How much force is needed to open the door?
10. Is the door locked? If so, how can it be unlocked?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0.5, 0.5) on the image.
Yes, the door handle is within the reach of the robotic arm.
The door has a lever handle.
The door handle is located on the right side of the door, approximately 1/3 from the bottom edge and 1/3 from the left edge.
Based on the image, the door appears to open towards the viewer, as the handle is on the right side and the letter slot is on the left.
Based on the image, the door handle appears to be a pull handle, suggesting that one would need to pull it to open the door.
The handle on the door appears to be a vertical bar handle. Typically, these handles are turned by rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise. Without specific markings or indicators on the handle, it's challenging to determine the exact number of degrees it needs to be turned. However, most such handles can be turned approximately 90 degrees to the right or left.
No, there is no object blocking the door that needs to be moved first.
The door appears to be a modern design with a matte finish, and given its size and the materials it seems to be made of, it would likely require a moderate amount of force to open. Depending on the lock mechanism and the weight of the door, one might estimate that around 20-30 pounds of force would be needed to open it. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual force might vary.
Yes, the door appears to be locked. It can be unlocked by using the keyhole and the key.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the location of the door to start the task.

2. **move_to(0.33, 0.67)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the location of the door handle, which is approximately 1/3 from the bottom edge and 1/3 from the left edge of the door.

3. **grab(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Grab the door handle to prepare for turning it.

4. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the handle 90 degrees to unlock the door, assuming it needs to be turned clockwise.

5. **pull(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Pull the handle to open the door, as the door opens towards the viewer.

6. **release(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Release the handle after the door is opened.

7. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm back to the initial position for any further tasks or to reset its position.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door location
move_to(0.5, 0.5)

# Move to the door handle location
move_to(0.33, 0.67)

# Grab the door handle
grab(handle)

# Rotate the handle 90 degrees
rotate(90)

# Pull the handle to open the door
pull(handle)

# Release the handle
release(handle)

# Move back to the initial position
move_to(0.5, 0.5)
```
