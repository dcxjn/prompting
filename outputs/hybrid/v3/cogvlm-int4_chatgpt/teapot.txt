=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The teapot is located on the left side of the table.
 The teapot appears to be blue in color and has a classic design with a spout and handle.
The teapot is on a table.
No, there is no object in the way of the teapot.
 The teapot is approximately 0.5 meters away from the robotic arm.
Based on the image, the teapot is placed on the table, and there are no indications or signs suggesting it needs to be moved to a special place. It appears to be part of the table setting.
The teapot appears to be light, given its small size and the simplistic design.
The teapot appears to be a ceramic or porcelain item, which typically has a smooth surface. Given its design and the absence of any visible handles or rough textures, it seems that it would be relatively easy to grasp with a robotic arm.
Yes, you should be careful not to break the teapot. It appears to be made of ceramic or porcelain, which are fragile materials.
The teapot appears to be cold, as there is no visible steam or smoke emanating from it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. **move_to(0.5, 0)**
   - **Reason:** The teapot is located 0.5 meters away from the robotic arm on the left side of the table. Moving to this position will place the arm close to the teapot.

2. **rotate(-90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotating the arm by -90 degrees will align the gripper with the teapot, ensuring that the arm is positioned correctly to grab it.

3. **move_to(0.5, 0.1)**
   - **Reason:** This slight adjustment ensures the arm is directly above the teapot, allowing for a precise grab.

4. **grab(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** The teapot needs to be securely held by the robotic arm. Given that the teapot is light and has a smooth surface, the arm should be able to grasp it without difficulty.

5. **move_to(0.5, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Lifting the teapot slightly off the table to ensure it is free from any surface friction or obstacles.

6. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotating the arm back to its original orientation to prepare for any further movement or placement.

7. **move_to(0.5, -0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Moving the teapot to a neutral position away from the table, ensuring it is safely held and ready for any additional instructions.

8. **release(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** If the task is simply to get the teapot and hold it, releasing it in a safe position completes the task. If further instructions are provided, the arm can proceed accordingly.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully locate, grab, and secure the teapot, ensuring it is handled with care to avoid any damage.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the left side of the table near the teapot
move_to(0.5, 0)

# Rotate the arm to align with the teapot
rotate(-90)

# Adjust position to be directly above the teapot
move_to(0.5, 0.1)

# Grab the teapot
grab(teapot)

# Lift the teapot slightly off the table
move_to(0.5, 0)

# Rotate the arm back to its original orientation
rotate(90)

# Move the teapot to a neutral position
move_to(0.5, -0.5)

# Release the teapot
release(teapot)
```
