=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door already unlocked?
- Does the door have a handle or a knob?
- Where is the handle or knob located on the door? (What are the x and y coordinates of the handle or knob?)
- Which way does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- How much force is needed to open the door? (Is it easy or hard to push/pull?)
- What is the angle of rotation needed to turn the handle or knob?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the center of the image, with its x-coordinate being approximately 0 (the leftmost edge of the image) and its y-coordinate being approximately 0.5 (the topmost edge of the image).
Yes, the door appears to be unlocked as there is no visible lock mechanism or handle on the door from the perspective of the image.
The door has a handle.
The handle or knob on the door is located at the center of the lower half of the door, approximately at the midpoint horizontally and slightly towards the right side when looking from the front.
The door appears to open towards you, as the handle is on the right side when facing the door.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a standard double door with a metal handle and deadbolt. Typically, such doors would require a moderate amount of force to open, especially if the deadbolt is engaged. However, without physically trying it, it's hard to determine the exact amount of force needed.
The angle of rotation needed to turn the handle or knob is typically 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the orientation of the handle. However, the exact angle may vary based on the design and mechanism of the door's handle.
No, there doesn't appear to be anything blocking the door from opening. The door handle is visible and seems to be in working order.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the door handle:**
   - Command: `move_to(0, 0.5)`
   - Reason: The door is located at the center of the image, with its x-coordinate being approximately 0 and its y-coordinate being approximately 0.5. Moving to this position will place the robot arm near the door handle.

2. **Move to the handle's specific location:**
   - Command: `move_to(0, 0.25)`
   - Reason: The handle is located at the center of the lower half of the door, approximately at the midpoint horizontally and slightly towards the right side. Moving to this position will align the robot arm with the handle.

3. **Grab the handle:**
   - Command: `grab(handle)`
   - Reason: To open the door, the robot needs to grab the handle first.

4. **Rotate the handle:**
   - Command: `rotate(90)`
   - Reason: The handle needs to be turned 90 degrees to unlock the door mechanism. The exact angle may vary, but 90 degrees is a typical rotation for door handles.

5. **Pull the door:**
   - Command: `pull(door)`
   - Reason: The door opens towards the robot, so pulling the door after turning the handle will open it.

6. **Release the handle:**
   - Command: `release(handle)`
   - Reason: Once the door is open, the robot can release the handle.

7. **Move back to the initial position:**
   - Command: `move_to(viewer_position)`
   - Reason: Returning to the initial position ensures the robot arm is out of the way and ready for the next task.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0, 0.5)  # Position near the door handle

# Move to the handle's specific location
move_to(0, 0.25)  # Align with the handle

# Grab the handle
grab(handle)  # Secure the handle

# Rotate the handle
rotate(90)  # Turn the handle to unlock

# Pull the door
pull(door)  # Open the door

# Release the handle
release(handle)  # Let go of the handle

# Move back to the initial position
move_to(viewer_position)  # Return to the starting point
```
