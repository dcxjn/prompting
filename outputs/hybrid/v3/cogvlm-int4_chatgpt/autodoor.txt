=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

1. Where is the door located? Can you give me the exact x and y coordinates?
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of handle does the door have? Is it a knob, lever, or something else?
5. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
6. If the door has a knob, do I need to turn it? If yes, in which direction and by how many degrees?
7. Is there any object blocking the door that I need to move first?
8. How much force is needed to open the door?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the bottom center of the image. The exact x coordinate is 0 (since the image is a 1x1 grid), and the y coordinate is 0.5 (halfway down from the top of the image).
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 2 feet 6 inches from the ground.
The door has a lever handle.
Based on the image, the door appears to be an automatic sliding door. There is no visible handle or mechanism to push or pull. It is likely that one would simply walk through it.
 The door does not appear to have a knob. It seems to be a push or slide mechanism. Therefore, you do not need to turn it.
No, there is no object blocking the door that needs to be moved first. The door appears to be clear and can be accessed directly.
The door appears to be an automatic sliding door, which typically requires no physical force to open. Instead, it operates based on sensors and electronic systems.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Given the information that the door is an automatic sliding door and the robot is in the position of the 'viewer', the robot does not need to physically manipulate the door. Instead, it needs to position itself in front of the door to trigger the sensors. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **move_to(0, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** The door is located at the bottom center of the image with coordinates (0, 0.5). Moving to this position will place the robot directly in front of the door.

2. **wait_for_door_to_open()**
   - **Reason:** Automatic sliding doors typically open when they detect a presence in front of them. The robot should wait for the door to open automatically.

3. **move_forward_through_door()**
   - **Reason:** Once the door opens, the robot should move forward to pass through the door. This step assumes the robot has a command to move forward a specific distance, which is not explicitly listed in the available commands but is implied by the task.

Since the robot's available commands do not include a specific "wait" or "move forward" command, we assume the robot has basic movement capabilities beyond the listed commands. If the robot only has the listed commands, the task would be limited to positioning itself in front of the door, as the door's automatic mechanism would handle the rest.

If additional commands are needed for the robot to move through the door, they should be specified by the system controlling the robot.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(0, 0.5)  # Position robot in front of the door
wait_for_door_to_open()  # Wait for the automatic door to open
move_forward_through_door()  # Move forward through the opened door
```
