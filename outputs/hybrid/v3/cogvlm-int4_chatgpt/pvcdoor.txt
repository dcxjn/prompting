- Where is the door located? (x, y coordinates)
- Is the door handle at a specific height? If so, what is the height?
- What type of door handle does the door have? (e.g., knob, lever)
- Which direction does the door open? (push or pull)
- If the door needs to be pushed, how much force is required?
- If the door needs to be pulled, how much force is required?
- Does the door handle need to be turned or rotated? If so, by how many degrees?
- Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
- Is the door locked? If so, how can it be unlocked?
- What is the size and shape of the door handle?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

 The door is located at the coordinates (0.5, 0.5).
Yes, the door handle is at a specific height. It appears to be positioned roughly at the middle of the door, which is a common placement for door handles to ensure easy access and functionality.
The door has a lever handle.
The door appears to open inwards, as evidenced by the hinges and the way the door panels fold. Typically, doors with this design open by pushing them towards the viewer.
Given the size and weight of the door, as well as the visible hinge mechanism, a moderate force would be required to push it open. Depending on the door's material and thickness, one might need to apply a force equivalent to lifting a small to medium-sized object, such as a bag of groceries or a box of books.
The door appears to be a modern folding door, which typically requires less force than a standard hinged door. Depending on its weight and the number of panels, a moderate force might be needed to pull it open. However, without specific details about the door's weight and construction, it's challenging to provide an exact figure.
The door handle appears to be a push-type, so it doesn't need to be turned or rotated.
No, there is no object blocking the door that needs to be moved first. The door appears to be open and clear.
Based on the image provided, the door appears to be unlocked. There is no visible lock mechanism or handle on the visible side of the door. To unlock it, one would likely need to approach the door from the inside and turn or push the door open.
The door handle appears to be rectangular in shape and is relatively small in size.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** The door is located at the coordinates (0.5, 0.5). The robot needs to move to this position to interact with the door.

2. **move_to(0.5, 0.5 + handle_height)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is positioned roughly at the middle of the door. The robot needs to adjust its height to reach the handle.

3. **grab(lever_handle)**
   - **Reason:** The door has a lever handle. The robot needs to grab the handle to push the door open.

4. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** The door opens inwards by pushing it. The robot needs to apply a moderate force to push the door open.

5. **release(lever_handle)**
   - **Reason:** After pushing the door open, the robot should release the handle to complete the task.

Here’s the step-by-step guide in a concise format:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - Move to the door's location.

2. **move_to(0.5, 0.5 + handle_height)**
   - Adjust height to reach the handle.

3. **grab(lever_handle)**
   - Grab the lever handle.

4. **push(door)**
   - Push the door open.

5. **release(lever_handle)**
   - Release the handle.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door's location
move_to(0.5, 0.5)

# Adjust height to reach the handle
move_to(0.5, 0.5 + handle_height)

# Grab the lever handle
grab(lever_handle)

# Push the door open
push(door)

# Release the handle
release(lever_handle)
```
