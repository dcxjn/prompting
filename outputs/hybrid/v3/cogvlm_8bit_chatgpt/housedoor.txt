=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
- What is the shape and size of the door handle?
- Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
- Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
- What angle should the robotic arm rotate to turn the door handle?
- After turning the handle, should the door be pushed or pulled to open it?
- How far should the door be moved to be fully open?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0). This is because the door is at the center of the image, with its top edge aligned at the top of the image and its bottom edge aligned at the bottom of the image.
No, the door handle is not within reach of the robotic arm. The arm is positioned to the left of the door, and the handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is round and appears to be of a medium size, fitting comfortably on the door.
The door handle in the image is a knob.
The door opens towards you.
The door appears to be locked. There is a visible doorknob on the door, but no visible keyhole or key, and the door handle is in its closed position.
The door handle appears to be a standard lever-style handle, which typically requires a moderate amount of force to turn. Depending on the door's weight and the quality of the hardware, it might require anywhere from 5 to 20 pounds of force to turn fully. However, without physically interacting with the door, it's impossible to provide an exact measurement.
To turn the door handle, the robotic arm should rotate at an angle of approximately 90 degrees clockwise.
The door should be pulled to open it.
The door appears to be fully open in the image, so no movement is required.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Given the answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **move_to(0, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the center of the image where the door is located. This is the starting point for interacting with the door.

2. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the right side of the door where the handle is located. Since the exact coordinates of the handle are not provided, assume a reasonable position based on the door's dimensions.

3. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robotic arm 90 degrees clockwise to align with the door handle. This is necessary to grab and turn the knob.

4. **grab(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** Grab the door handle to prepare for turning it. This step is essential for interacting with the handle.

5. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robotic arm another 90 degrees clockwise to turn the door handle. This action unlocks the door.

6. **pull(door)**
   - **Reason:** Pull the door towards the viewer to open it. Since the door opens towards you, this action will open the door.

7. **release(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** Release the door handle after the door is opened. This completes the task of opening the door.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the arm interacts correctly with the door handle and performs the necessary actions to open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(0, 0)  # Move to the center of the image
move_to(x, y)  # Move to the door handle position
rotate(90)  # Rotate to align with the door handle
grab(door_handle)  # Grab the door handle
rotate(90)  # Turn the door handle
pull(door)  # Pull the door to open it
release(door_handle)  # Release the door handle
```
