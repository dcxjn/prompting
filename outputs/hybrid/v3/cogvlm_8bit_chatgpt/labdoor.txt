=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (x, y coordinates)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (e.g., knob, lever, pull handle)
- Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What angle should the door be rotated to open fully?
- Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0).
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet (or 75 centimeters) from the ground.
The door handle is a lever.
The door appears to open by pulling, as evidenced by the handle's position on the right side and the orientation of the door's swing.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a standard double door with a metallic handle and deadbolt mechanism. Typically, such doors require a moderate amount of force to open, especially if they are locked. It would be advisable to use a key or a handle tool to assist in opening the door. However, without knowing the specific weight or type of lock used, it's challenging to provide an exact force measurement.
The door appears to be a double door with two panels. Typically, such doors open inwards by rotating around their vertical axis. To open fully, you would need to rotate each panel approximately 90 degrees inwards from its closed position.
No, there is no object blocking the door that needs to be moved first. The door appears to be clear and ready to be accessed.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the door handle:**
   ```move_to(0, 75)```
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at the coordinates (0, 75 cm) from the ground. The robot needs to position itself at the handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the door handle:**
   ```grab("door handle")```
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a lever, and the robot needs to grab it to pull the door open.

3. **Pull the door handle:**
   ```pull("door handle")```
   - **Reason:** The door opens by pulling, so the robot needs to pull the handle to disengage the latch mechanism.

4. **Move back slightly to create space for the door to open:**
   ```move_to(-10, 75)```
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to create space for the door to swing open. Moving back slightly ensures that the door can open without obstruction.

5. **Rotate the door panel:**
   ```rotate(90)```
   - **Reason:** The door needs to be rotated approximately 90 degrees inwards to open fully. This step ensures that the door is fully open.

6. **Release the door handle:**
   ```release("door handle")```
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can release the handle as the task is complete.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0, 75)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door handle")

# Pull the door handle
pull("door handle")

# Move back slightly to create space for the door to open
move_to(-10, 75)

# Rotate the door panel
rotate(90)

# Release the door handle
release("door handle")
```
