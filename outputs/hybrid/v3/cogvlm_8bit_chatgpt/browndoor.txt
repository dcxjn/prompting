=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Does the door open by pulling or pushing?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What is the angle to which the door needs to be rotated to open fully?
- Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0), as it is the central element in the image and is at the origin point.
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet from the ground.
The door handle in the image appears to be a knob. It is round and lacks the extended arm typical of a lever.
The door opens by pulling. This can be determined by the placement of the doorknob on the right side of the door, which is a common placement for right-handed doors.
To determine the force needed to open the door, we would typically look for signs of resistance or obstruction. In this image, the door appears to be closed and there are no visible handles or knobs to apply force to. However, if we assume that the door is locked, we would need to apply a certain amount of force to turn the lock mechanism to unlock it. The amount of force would depend on the type and strength of the lock, as well as the door's weight and construction. Without additional context or the ability to physically interact with the door, it's not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the force required.
The door appears to be closed, and without knowing the exact orientation of the door's hinge or the space it opens into, it's challenging to provide an accurate rotation angle. However, if we assume the door opens outward from the room and the hinge is on the side opposite to the viewer, the door would likely need to rotate inwards to open fully. The exact angle would depend on the door's width and the distance from the wall to the hinge.
No, there is no visible object blocking the door that needs to be moved first. The door appears to be in a clear path.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0, 2.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at the coordinates (0, 2.5) feet from the ground. The robot needs to position itself at the handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(knob)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a knob, and the robot needs to grab it to turn and pull the door open.

3. **Rotate the Knob:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** Assuming the knob needs to be turned 90 degrees to unlock the door, the robot rotates the knob to unlock it.

4. **Pull the Door:**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** The door opens by pulling. The robot needs to pull the door towards itself to open it.

5. **Move Back to Allow the Door to Open Fully:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(-1, 2.5)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to move back to give space for the door to open fully. Moving to (-1, 2.5) ensures the robot is still aligned with the handle but at a safe distance.

6. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(knob)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can release the knob.

7. **Move to the Side to Clear the Path:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(-1, 0)`
   - **Reason:** Moving to (-1, 0) ensures the robot is out of the way, allowing the door to be fully open and clear for passage.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0, 2.5)

# Grab the door handle
grab(knob)

# Rotate the knob to unlock the door
rotate(90)

# Pull the door to open it
pull(door)

# Move back to allow the door to open fully
move_to(-1, 2.5)

# Release the door handle
release(knob)

# Move to the side to clear the path
move_to(-1, 0)
```
