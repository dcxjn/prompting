=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (x, y coordinates)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (e.g., knob, lever, pull handle)
- Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What angle should the door be rotated to open fully?
- Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0), as it is the starting point of the image and occupies the entire width and height of the image.
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet (75 cm) from the ground.
The door handle in the image is a pull handle.
The door appears to open by pulling, as evidenced by the handle located on the right side of the door, which is typically where one would pull to open it.
The door appears to be a modern glass door with a black frame. Typically, such doors are designed to be opened with minimal force, often requiring just a gentle push. The door's weight and the hinges' design also contribute to its ease of opening. However, without knowing the door's exact size, material thickness, or the presence of any locks or security features, it's challenging to provide an exact force measurement. Generally, for a standard-sized interior door like this, a light push would suffice.
The door should be rotated to the left to open fully.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door. It appears to be clear for passage.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0, 75)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at the coordinates (0, 75 cm) from the ground. The robot needs to position itself at the handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to secure the door handle to pull the door open.

3. **Pull the Door**
   - **Command:** `pull(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The door is a pull-type door, so the robot needs to pull the handle to open it.

4. **Rotate the Door to the Left**
   - **Command:** `rotate(-90)`
   - **Reason:** The door should be rotated to the left to open fully. Assuming a 90-degree rotation is sufficient to open the door completely.

5. **Release the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can release the handle as the task is complete.

### Summary of Commands
1. `move_to(0, 75)`
2. `grab(door_handle)`
3. `pull(door_handle)`
4. `rotate(-90)`
5. `release(door_handle)`

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.
