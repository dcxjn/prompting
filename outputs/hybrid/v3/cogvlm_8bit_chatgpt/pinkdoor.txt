=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
- What is the shape and size of the door handle?
- Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
- Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
- What angle should the robotic arm rotate to turn the door handle?
- After turning the handle, should the door be pushed or pulled to open it?
- How far does the door need to be moved to be fully open?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0.5, 0.5) on the image.
No, the door handle is not within reach of the robotic arm. The arm is positioned to the left of the door, and the handle is on the right side of the door, making it out of the arm's reach.
The door handle is round in shape and appears to be of a standard size, fitting comfortably on the door.
The door handle in the image is a knob.
The door appears to open towards you. This is inferred from the position of the doorknob on the right side of the door, which is typically on the inside of the door when opening from the outside.
The door appears to be locked. There is a visible doorknob on the door, but there is no visible keyhole or any indication that the door is currently unlocked.
The door handle appears to be a standard round doorknob, which typically requires a moderate amount of force to turn. Depending on the door's weight and the quality of the hardware, it might require anywhere from 5 to 20 pounds of force to turn it fully. However, without physically interacting with the door, it's impossible to provide an exact measurement.
To turn the door handle, the robotic arm should rotate at an angle of approximately 90 degrees clockwise.
Based on the orientation of the door handle, it appears to be a push door. Typically, handles on the right side of doors are used for pushing, while those on the left are used for pulling.
The door appears to be fully open in the image. Therefore, no movement is needed to fully open it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Given the answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the location of the door. This is the starting point for interacting with the door.

2. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robotic arm 90 degrees clockwise to align it with the door handle. This is necessary to position the arm correctly for the next steps.

3. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Since the door handle is not within reach, the robot needs to move closer to the handle. However, the exact coordinates (x, y) are not provided. Assuming the robot can move closer to the handle, this step would involve moving to a position where the handle is within reach.

4. **grab(door handle)**
   - **Reason:** Grab the door handle to prepare for turning it. This step is essential for interacting with the door handle.

5. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the door handle 90 degrees clockwise to unlock the door. This is the standard action for turning a round doorknob.

6. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** Push the door to open it. Since the door opens towards the viewer, pushing it will move it in the correct direction to open.

7. **release(door handle)**
   - **Reason:** Release the door handle after the door is open. This completes the interaction with the door handle.

8. **move_to(starting position)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm back to its starting position. This resets the arm for any future tasks.

By following these steps, the robotic arm can successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the arm interacts with the door handle correctly and opens the door as required.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(0.5, 0.5)  # Move to the door location
rotate(90)  # Align with the door handle
move_to(x, y)  # Move closer to the door handle (exact coordinates needed)
grab(door_handle)  # Grab the door handle
rotate(90)  # Turn the door handle to unlock
push(door)  # Push the door to open
release(door_handle)  # Release the door handle
move_to(starting_position)  # Return to the starting position
```
