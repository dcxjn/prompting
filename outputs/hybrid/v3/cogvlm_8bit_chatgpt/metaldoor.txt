=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (x, y coordinates)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (e.g., knob, lever, pull handle)
- Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What is the angle to rotate the handle to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0), as it is the central point of the image.
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet (75 centimeters) above the ground.
The door handle in the image is a lever.
The door appears to open by pulling, as evidenced by the handle's placement on the right side of the door and the orientation of the door's frame.
The door appears to be a heavy-duty metal door with a window and a handle, suggesting it is designed for security and durability. Typically, such doors require a significant amount of force to open, especially if they are locked. Depending on the door's weight, the type of lock, and the handle's strength, it could require anywhere from 20 to 50 pounds of force or more to open manually. If there's a lock mechanism, it would likely need to be engaged and the correct key or code would be needed to unlock it.
The handle on the door is located on the right side, and it appears to be a lever-style handle. Typically, lever handles rotate counterclockwise to open the door. Therefore, to open the door, you would rotate the handle counterclockwise.
Yes, there is a cylindrical object, possibly a bollard or a post, positioned in front of the door. It would need to be moved to allow access to the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. **Identify the cylindrical object in front of the door:**
   - **Reason:** The cylindrical object needs to be moved first to allow access to the door.

2. **Move to the cylindrical object:**
   - `move_to(x, y)` where `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the cylindrical object.
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm close enough to interact with the object.

3. **Grab the cylindrical object:**
   - `grab(cylindrical_object)`
   - **Reason:** Secure the object to move it out of the way.

4. **Move the cylindrical object to a new location:**
   - `move_to(new_x, new_y)` where `(new_x, new_y)` are coordinates away from the door.
   - **Reason:** Clear the path to the door.

5. **Release the cylindrical object:**
   - `release(cylindrical_object)`
   - **Reason:** Free the robotic arm to perform the next tasks.

6. **Move to the door handle:**
   - `move_to(0, 75)` (since the door handle is 75 cm above the ground and the door is at (0, 0)).
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm to interact with the door handle.

7. **Rotate the handle counterclockwise:**
   - `rotate(-90)` (assuming -90 degrees is the required angle to open the lever handle).
   - **Reason:** Unlock the door by rotating the lever handle.

8. **Pull the door:**
   - `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** Open the door by pulling it towards the viewer.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully move the obstacle and open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Step 1: Identify the cylindrical object in front of the door
cylindrical_object = identify_object("cylindrical")

# Step 2: Move to the cylindrical object
move_to(cylindrical_object.x, cylindrical_object.y)

# Step 3: Grab the cylindrical object
grab(cylindrical_object)

# Step 4: Move the cylindrical object to a new location
move_to(new_x, new_y)

# Step 5: Release the cylindrical object
release(cylindrical_object)

# Step 6: Move to the door handle
move_to(0, 75)

# Step 7: Rotate the handle counterclockwise
rotate(-90)

# Step 8: Pull the door
pull(door)
```
