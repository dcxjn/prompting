=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the door.)
2. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Where is the handle located on the door? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the handle.)
4. How does the handle need to be moved to open the door? (Does it need to be turned, pushed, or pulled?)
5. If the handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
6. Is the door locked? (If yes, how can it be unlocked?)
7. Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door or the handle?
10. What is the size and shape of the handle? (This helps in determining how to grab it.)

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

1. The door is located on the right side of the image. Its x-coordinate ranges from approximately 0.25 to 0.75, and its y-coordinate is around 0.50 to 0.98.
2. The door has a lever-type handle.
3. The handle is located on the right side of the door, near the top. Its x-coordinate is around 0.60 to 0.70, and its y-coordinate is around 0.45 to 0.55.
4. The handle needs to be pushed down to open the door.
5. The handle should be pushed down by approximately 45 degrees.
6. The door is not locked.
7. The door opens by pushing down on the handle.
8. The force needed to push down the handle is moderate.
9. There are no obstacles in the way of the door or the handle.
10. The handle is rectangular in shape, with a flat surface on top.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(0.65, 0.50)**
   - **Reason:** This command moves the robotic arm to the location of the door handle, which is at approximately (0.65, 0.50) in the image.

2. **grab(handle)**
   - **Reason:** This command ensures that the robotic arm securely grabs the lever handle, which is necessary to manipulate it.

3. **rotate(-45)**
   - **Reason:** This command rotates the handle down by 45 degrees, which is required to open the door. The negative sign indicates a downward rotation.

4. **release(handle)**
   - **Reason:** This command releases the handle after it has been rotated to the necessary position to open the door.

5. **move_to(0.65, 0.75)**
   - **Reason:** This command moves the robotic arm to a position slightly lower on the door, preparing it to push the door open.

6. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** This command pushes the door open. Since the handle has already been rotated down, the door should now open with a push.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each command is designed to precisely manipulate the door handle and then push the door open, ensuring the task is completed efficiently.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle location
move_to(0.65, 0.50)

# Grab the door handle
grab(handle)

# Rotate the handle down by 45 degrees
rotate(-45)

# Release the handle
release(handle)

# Move to a position to push the door
move_to(0.65, 0.75)

# Push the door open
push(door)
```
