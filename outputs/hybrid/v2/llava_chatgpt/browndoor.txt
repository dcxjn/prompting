=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help understand how to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. In which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
6. How much force is needed to turn or push the door handle?
7. Do I need to turn the handle to open the door? If yes, by how many degrees?
8. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
9. Is the door locked? If yes, how do I unlock it?
10. After turning the handle, do I need to push or pull the door to open it?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help understand how to open the door using the robotic arm:

10. After turning the handle, do I need to push or pull the door to open it?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the center of the image, with the x-coordinate at approximately 0.35 and the y-coordinate at approximately 0.50.
2. The door handle is on the right side of the door.
3. The door handle is at approximately the same height as the door handle itself, which is around 0.50 from the ground.
4. The door handle is a lever-type handle.
5. The door opens towards you.
6. The force needed to turn or push the door handle is not specified, but it should be a reasonable amount for a lever-type handle to operate smoothly.
7. To open the door, you need to turn the handle. The degree of turn is not specified, but typically a lever-type handle should require a 90-degree turn to open the door.
8. There is no object blocking the door in the image.
9. The door is not locked in the image.
10. After turning the handle, you need to push the door to open it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each instruction:

1. **Move to the door handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.35, 0.50)
   ```
   *Reason:* The door handle is located at the coordinates (0.35, 0.50). The robotic arm needs to move to this position to interact with the handle.

2. **Grab the door handle:**
   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* To turn the lever-type handle, the robotic arm needs to grab it securely.

3. **Rotate the handle:**
   ```python
   rotate(90)
   ```
   *Reason:* Lever-type handles typically require a 90-degree turn to open the door. Rotating the handle will disengage the latch.

4. **Release the door handle:**
   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* After turning the handle, the robotic arm needs to release it to proceed with pushing the door.

5. **Move to a position to push the door:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.35, 0.55)
   ```
   *Reason:* Moving slightly lower and closer to the door will position the robotic arm to push the door effectively.

6. **Push the door:**
   ```python
   push("door")
   ```
   *Reason:* Since the door opens towards the viewer, pushing the door will open it.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the arm interacts with the door handle correctly and applies the necessary actions to open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0.35, 0.50)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door_handle")

# Rotate the handle
rotate(90)

# Release the door handle
release("door_handle")

# Move to a position to push the door
move_to(0.35, 0.55)

# Push the door
push("door")
```
