=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some questions to help us get the teapot using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the teapot right now? (Can you tell me the x and y coordinates of the teapot?)
2. Is the teapot on a table or on the floor?
3. Is there anything in the way of the robotic arm reaching the teapot?
4. What does the teapot look like? (Is it big or small, heavy or light?)
5. Can the teapot be grabbed easily, or does it need to be pushed or pulled first?
6. Is the teapot fragile? (Do we need to be very careful when grabbing it?)
7. Do we need to rotate the teapot to pick it up properly?
8. Where should we put the teapot after we grab it? (Can you tell me the x and y coordinates of the destination?)
9. Is there anything else we need to know about the teapot or the area around it?

These questions will help us understand exactly what we need to do to get the teapot using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. The teapot is located on the table, approximately at the center of the image, with its x and y coordinates being around (0.5,0.450).
2. The teapot is on a table.
3. There are no visible obstacles in the way of the robotic arm reaching the teapot.
4. The teapot appears to be a small, lightweight object, suitable for the robotic arm to grab without difficulty.
5. The teapot can be grabbed easily without the need for pushing or pulling first.
6. Based on its size and shape, the teapot does not seem to be particularly fragile. However, it would be advisable to handle it gently to avoid any damage.
7. There is no need to rotate the teapot to pick it up properly.
8. After grabbing the teapot, it should be placed on a surface that is stable and secure, such as a tray or a plate, with its x and y coordinates being approximately (0.750,0.700).
9. There is no other significant information about the teapot or the area around it that would affect its handling.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to get the teapot and place it on a stable surface, along with the reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.450)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the location of the teapot, which is at the center of the table with coordinates (0.5, 0.450).

2. **grab(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** Since the teapot can be grabbed easily and there are no obstacles, the robotic arm should grab the teapot.

3. **move_to(0.750, 0.700)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm, while holding the teapot, to the destination coordinates (0.750, 0.700), which is a stable and secure surface.

4. **release(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** Release the teapot onto the stable surface, completing the task of moving it from the table to the designated location.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully pick up the teapot from the table and place it on a stable surface.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the location of the teapot
move_to(0.5, 0.450)

# Grab the teapot
grab(teapot)

# Move to the destination coordinates
move_to(0.750, 0.700)

# Release the teapot onto the stable surface
release(teapot)
```
