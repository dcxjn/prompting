=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it push open or pull open?)
5. If the door handle is a knob, does it need to be turned to the left or right to open?
6. If the door handle is a lever, does it need to be pushed down or pulled up to open?
7. What is the angle of rotation needed to turn the door handle?
8. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
9. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
10. Are there any safety precautions to be aware of while opening the door?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the center of the image, with the x-coordinate being the center of the door and the y-coordinate being the center of the door.

2. The door handle is a lever.

3. The height of the door handle from the ground is approximately 3 feet.

4. The door opens outward.

5. To open the door, the lever needs to be pulled up.

6. No force is needed to open the door, as it is already open.

7. There is no specific angle of rotation needed to turn the door handle.

8. There are no objects blocking the door that need to be moved first.

9. No force is needed to open the door, as it is already open.

10. There are no safety precautions to be aware of while opening the door, as it is already open.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the location of the door handle. Since the door handle is at the center of the door and 3 feet from the ground, the coordinates would be the center of the door at the specified height.
   - **Command:** `move_to(center_x, center_y - 3 feet)`

2. **grab(lever)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a lever that needs to be pulled up to open the door. The robotic arm needs to grab the lever to manipulate it.
   - **Command:** `grab(lever)`

3. **pull(lever)**
   - **Reason:** The lever needs to be pulled up to open the door. This action will disengage the latch mechanism.
   - **Command:** `pull(lever)`

4. **release(lever)**
   - **Reason:** After pulling the lever up, the robotic arm can release the lever as the door is now ready to be opened.
   - **Command:** `release(lever)`

5. **move_to(center_x, center_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the center of the door to push it open. Since the door opens outward, the arm needs to be positioned to push the door.
   - **Command:** `move_to(center_x, center_y)`

6. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** Push the door outward to open it. Since the door is already unlocked, this action will open the door.
   - **Command:** `push(door)`

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each command is designed to interact with the door handle and the door itself in a logical sequence to achieve the desired outcome.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle location
move_to(center_x, center_y - 3 feet)

# Grab the door handle lever
grab(lever)

# Pull the lever to unlock the door
pull(lever)

# Release the lever
release(lever)

# Move to the center of the door
move_to(center_x, center_y)

# Push the door to open it
push(door)
```
