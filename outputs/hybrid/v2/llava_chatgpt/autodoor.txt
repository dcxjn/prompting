=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? Can you give me the exact x and y coordinates of the door handle?
2. What does the door handle look like? Is it a knob, a lever, or something else?
3. How high off the ground is the door handle? Can you give me the exact height in centimeters or inches?
4. Which direction does the door open? Does it open towards me or away from me?
5. Do I need to turn the door handle to open the door? If yes, which direction should I turn it and by how many degrees?
6. Is the door locked? If yes, do I need a key or a code to unlock it?
7. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open? Can you give me an idea if it's heavy or light?
8. Are there any obstacles near the door that I should be aware of? If yes, where are they located?
9. Is there anything I need to avoid touching while opening the door?
10. After opening the door, should I leave it open or close it behind me?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? Can you give me the exact x and y coordinates of the door handle?
2. What does the door handle look like? Is it a knob, a lever, or something else?
3. How high off the ground is the door handle? Can you give me the exact height in centimeters or inches?
4. Which direction does the door open? Does it open towards me or away from me?

9. Is there anything I need to avoid touching while opening the door?
10. After opening the door, should I leave it open or close it behind me?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located in the center of the image, with the door handle positioned at approximately x=0.45, y=0.73.

2. The door handle is a lever-style handle.

3. The door handle is approximately 0.8 feet (0.25 meters) above the ground.

4. The door opens towards the viewer.

5. To open the door, you would need to push the lever-style handle down.

6. There is no indication of the door being locked in the image.

7. The force required to open the door seems to be relatively light, as it is not visibly heavy or requiring significant effort to open.

8. There are no visible obstacles near the door in the image.

9. There are no visible hazards or things to avoid touching while opening the door.

10. After opening the door, it should be left open.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with the reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(0.45, 0.73)**
   - **Reason:** This command moves the robotic arm to the position of the door handle, which is located at x=0.45, y=0.73.

2. **grab(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** This command ensures that the robotic arm securely grips the lever-style door handle, preparing to push it down.

3. **rotate(-45)**
   - **Reason:** This command rotates the lever-style handle downwards. Assuming a standard lever handle, a 45-degree rotation should be sufficient to disengage the latch mechanism.

4. **release(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** This command releases the door handle after it has been pushed down, allowing the robotic arm to proceed to the next step.

5. **move_to(0.45, 0.73)**
   - **Reason:** This command repositions the robotic arm back to the door handle's location to prepare for pushing the door open.

6. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** This command pushes the door open. Since the door opens towards the viewer, pushing the door will cause it to swing open.

7. **move_to(0.45, 0.73)**
   - **Reason:** This command ensures the robotic arm is back at the initial position to verify that the door is fully open.

8. **release(door)**
   - **Reason:** This command releases any remaining contact with the door, ensuring the door stays open as instructed.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door and leave it open, as required.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle position
move_to(0.45, 0.73)

# Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Rotate the handle downwards
rotate(-45)

# Release the door handle
release(door_handle)

# Reposition to the door handle location
move_to(0.45, 0.73)

# Push the door open
push(door)

# Verify the door is fully open
move_to(0.45, 0.73)

# Release any remaining contact with the door
release(door)
```
