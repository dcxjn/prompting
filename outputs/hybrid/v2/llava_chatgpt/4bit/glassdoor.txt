=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What are the x and y coordinates of the door handle?
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. If it is a knob, do I need to turn it? If yes, by how many degrees?
6. If it is a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up? By how much?
7. After turning or moving the handle, do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
8. If I need to push or pull the door, what are the x and y coordinates where I should apply the force?
9. How much force should I use to push or pull the door?
10. Is there anything blocking the door that I need to move first?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the top right corner of the image, with the x coordinate being the far right edge of the image and the y coordinate being the top edge of the image.

2. The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. The x and y coordinates of the door handle are approximately at the right edge of the image.

4. The door handle is a knob.

5. Yes, you need to turn the knob. The number of degrees to turn is not visible in the image.

6. If it's a knob, you need to turn it. The number of degrees to turn is not visible in the image.

7. If it's a knob, you need to turn it. The number of degrees to turn is not visible in the image.

8. If it's a knob, you need to turn it. The number of degrees to turn is not visible in the image.

9. The force required to turn a knob is not visible in the image.

10. There is nothing blocking the door in the image.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at the right edge of the image. We need to move the robotic arm to the coordinates of the door handle to interact with it.
   - **Example:** `move_to(right_edge, top_edge)`

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** To turn the knob, the robotic arm needs to securely grab the door handle.
   - **Example:** `grab(door_handle)`

3. **Rotate the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a knob, and it needs to be turned to open the door. Since the exact angle is not provided, we will assume a standard 90 degrees for a typical door knob.
   - **Example:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Note:** If the door does not open, adjust the angle incrementally.

4. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** After turning the knob, the robotic arm needs to release the handle to proceed with opening the door.
   - **Example:** `release(door_handle)`

5. **Push the Door:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** After turning the knob, the door needs to be pushed to open it. The exact coordinates for pushing are not provided, so we will assume pushing near the handle area.
   - **Example:** `push(door)`
   - **Note:** If the door does not open, adjust the force incrementally.

### Summary of Commands:
1. `move_to(right_edge, top_edge)`
2. `grab(door_handle)`
3. `rotate(90)`
4. `release(door_handle)`
5. `push(door)`

### Reasons for Each Instruction:
1. **Move to the Door Handle:** To position the robotic arm at the door handle's location.
2. **Grab the Door Handle:** To securely hold the knob for turning.
3. **Rotate the Door Handle:** To unlock the door by turning the knob.
4. **Release the Door Handle:** To free the arm for the next action.
5. **Push the Door:** To open the door after unlocking it.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door.
