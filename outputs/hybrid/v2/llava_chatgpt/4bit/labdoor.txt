=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. If it is a knob, do I need to turn it to open the door? If yes, which direction should I turn it (clockwise or counterclockwise)?
6. If it is a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up to open the door?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, how do I unlock it?
8. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
9. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
10. Is there anything blocking the door that I need to move first?
11. What is the angle of rotation needed to fully open the door?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

10. Is there anything blocking the door that I need to move first?
11. What is the angle of rotation needed to fully open the door?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the center of the image, with the left side being the leftmost point and the right side being the rightmost point.

2. The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. The door handle is at a height of approximately 1.5 meters from the ground.

4. The door handle is a lever.

5. To open the door, you would need to push the lever down.

6. There is no indication of a lock mechanism visible in the image, so it is not possible to determine if the door is locked or how to unlock it.

7. The door appears to be unlocked, as there is no indication of a lock or mechanism to lock it.

8. To open the door, you would need to push it.

9. The force needed to open the door is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a standard weighted door that would require a moderate amount of force to open.

10. There is no visible obstruction in the image that would need to be moved first.

11. The image does not provide enough information to determine the angle of rotation needed to fully open the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(x, 1.5)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is located at a height of 1.5 meters from the ground. Moving to this position ensures the robotic arm is aligned with the handle.

2. **Push the Lever Down:**
   ```python
   push(lever)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a lever that needs to be pushed down to open the door. This action will disengage the latch mechanism.

3. **Move Back Slightly:**
   ```python
   move_to(x, 1.5 - 0.1)
   ```
   **Reason:** Moving back slightly ensures that the robotic arm has enough space to push the door without being obstructed by the handle.

4. **Push the Door:**
   ```python
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door needs to be pushed to open. This action will apply the necessary force to move the door.

5. **Rotate to Open the Door Fully:**
   ```python
   rotate(90)
   ```
   **Reason:** Although the exact angle of rotation is not provided, a 90-degree rotation is a standard angle to fully open most doors. This ensures the door is completely open.

### Summary of Commands
```python
move_to(x, 1.5)       # Move to the door handle height
push(lever)           # Push the lever down
move_to(x, 1.4)       # Move back slightly to avoid obstruction
push(door)            # Push the door to open it
rotate(90)            # Rotate to fully open the door
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Force Adjustment:** If the door does not open with a standard push, the force may need to be adjusted. This can be done by applying incremental force until the door starts to move.
- **Obstacle Check:** Although there are no visible obstructions, the robot should be programmed to stop if it encounters unexpected resistance to avoid damage.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
move_to(x, 1.5)       # Move to the door handle height
push(lever)           # Push the lever down
move_to(x, 1.4)       # Move back slightly to avoid obstruction
push(door)            # Push the door to open it
rotate(90)            # Rotate to fully open the door
```
