=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
2. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Where is the handle located on the door? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
4. Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
5. If the door has a knob, which way do you turn it to open? (Clockwise or counterclockwise?)
6. How many degrees should the knob be turned to open the door?
7. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How heavy is the door? (This helps to know how much force is needed to push or pull it.)
9. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
10. If the door is locked, do we have the key to unlock it?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

10. If the door is locked, do we have the key to unlock it?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the entrance to a building, specifically at the bottom of a brick wall.
2. The door has a lever handle.
3. The handle is located in the center of the door, at the bottom.
4. The door opens by pulling.
5. To open the door, the lever handle should be pulled down.
6. The exact number of degrees to turn the handle is not provided, but it is typically around 90 degrees for a lever handle to open the door.
7. There is no object blocking the door in the image.
8. The weight of the door is not visible in the image, but it is a standard residential door, which typically weighs between 50-100 pounds.
9. There is no visible lock or keyhole in the image.
10. The image does not provide information about whether there is a key to unlock the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm in front of the door handle.
   - **Command:** `move_to(center of the door, bottom of the door)`
   - **Example:** `move_to(50, 100)` (assuming the center of the door is at coordinates (50, 100))

2. **grab(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Securely grasp the lever handle to manipulate it.
   - **Command:** `grab(handle)`
   - **Example:** `grab("lever handle")`

3. **rotate(angle)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the lever handle down to unlock the door mechanism.
   - **Command:** `rotate(-90)`
   - **Example:** `rotate(-90)` (assuming a 90-degree downward rotation is needed)

4. **pull(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Pull the door open since it opens by pulling.
   - **Command:** `pull(handle)`
   - **Example:** `pull("lever handle")`

5. **release(handle)**
   - **Reason:** Release the handle after the door is opened.
   - **Command:** `release(handle)`
   - **Example:** `release("lever handle")`

6. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm out of the way to allow the door to open fully.
   - **Command:** `move_to(safe position)`
   - **Example:** `move_to(0, 0)` (assuming (0, 0) is a safe position away from the door)

### Summary of Commands:
1. `move_to(50, 100)`
2. `grab("lever handle")`
3. `rotate(-90)`
4. `pull("lever handle")`
5. `release("lever handle")`
6. `move_to(0, 0)`

### Reasons for Each Instruction:
1. **Positioning:** The robotic arm needs to be in the correct position to interact with the door handle.
2. **Grasping:** The arm must securely hold the handle to manipulate it.
3. **Rotating:** The lever handle needs to be rotated to disengage the latch mechanism.
4. **Pulling:** The door opens by pulling, so the arm must pull the handle to open the door.
5. **Releasing:** Once the door is open, the handle can be released.
6. **Moving Away:** The arm should move to a safe position to avoid obstructing the door as it opens.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
