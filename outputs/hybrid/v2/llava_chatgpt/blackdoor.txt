=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. Does the door handle need to be turned or pushed to open the door?
6. If the door handle needs to be turned, how many degrees should it be rotated?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
8. If the door is locked, where is the key to unlock it?
9. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
10. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the bottom of a brick wall, centered horizontally.
2. The door handle is a lever.
3. The door handle is located at the center of the door, horizontally.
4. The door opens towards you.
5. The door handle needs to be pushed to open the door.
6. The door handle should be pushed approximately 10 degrees to open the door.
7. The door is locked. The keyhole is located at the bottom of the door, centered horizontally.
8. The key to unlock the door is located in the keyhole.
9. The force needed to open the door is moderate, requiring a gentle push or pull.
10. There are no visible obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Instruction:** move_to(center_x, center_y - handle_height)
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm near the door handle to prepare for interaction.

2. **grab(handle)**
   - **Instruction:** grab(handle)
   - **Reason:** Securely hold the door handle to manipulate it.

3. **push(handle)**
   - **Instruction:** push(handle)
   - **Reason:** Push the handle approximately 10 degrees to unlock the door.

4. **release(handle)**
   - **Instruction:** release(handle)
   - **Reason:** Release the handle after it has been pushed to the correct position.

5. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Instruction:** move_to(center_x, center_y - door_height)
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm near the bottom of the door to interact with the keyhole.

6. **grab(key)**
   - **Instruction:** grab(key)
   - **Reason:** Securely hold the key to unlock the door.

7. **rotate(key, 90)**
   - **Instruction:** rotate(key, 90)
   - **Reason:** Rotate the key 90 degrees to unlock the door.

8. **release(key)**
   - **Instruction:** release(key)
   - **Reason:** Release the key after unlocking the door.

9. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Instruction:** move_to(center_x, center_y - handle_height)
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm back near the door handle to open the door.

10. **grab(handle)**
    - **Instruction:** grab(handle)
    - **Reason:** Securely hold the door handle to pull the door open.

11. **pull(handle)**
    - **Instruction:** pull(handle)
    - **Reason:** Gently pull the door towards you to open it.

12. **release(handle)**
    - **Instruction:** release(handle)
    - **Reason:** Release the handle after the door is opened.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the robotic arm interacts with the door and its components in the correct sequence and manner.
