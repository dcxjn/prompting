=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the door.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground? (Please provide the y coordinate of the door handle.)
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. Does the door handle need to be turned, pushed, or pulled to open the door?
6. If the door handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, how can it be unlocked?
8. Does the door open inward or outward?
9. If the door opens inward, should it be pulled? If it opens outward, should it be pushed?
10. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
11. Are there any obstacles in the way of the robotic arm that need to be moved first?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the door.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground? (Please provide the y coordinate of the door handle.)
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. Does the door handle need to be turned, pushed, or pulled to open the door?
6. If the door handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, how can it be unlocked?
8. Does the door open inward or outward?
9. If the door opens inward, should it be pulled? If it opens outward, should it be pushed?
10. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
11. Are there any obstacles in the way of the robotic arm that need to be moved first?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at x=0 and y=0 in the image.
2. The door handle is on the right side of the door.
3. The door handle is at a height of approximately y=0.6 from the ground.
4. The door handle is a lever-type handle.
5. The door handle needs to be pushed to open the door.
6. The lever-type handle should be pushed approximately 90 degrees to open the door.
7. The door appears to be locked. To unlock it, a key or a lockpick would be required.
8. The door opens inward.
9. If the door opens inward, it should be pulled to open.
10. The force needed to open the door is not visible in the image, but it would typically be a moderate amount of force to push or pull the door open.
11. There are no visible obstacles in the way of the robotic arm that would need to be moved first.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Certainly! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with the reasons for each instruction:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(0, 0.6)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is located at x=0 and y=0.6. Moving the robotic arm to this position will allow it to interact with the handle.

2. **Push the Lever Handle Down:**
   ```python
   push(handle)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a lever-type handle that needs to be pushed down approximately 90 degrees to open the door.

3. **Move to the Door Edge:**
   ```python
   move_to(0, 0)
   ```
   **Reason:** After pushing the handle, the robotic arm needs to move to the edge of the door to pull it open. The door edge is at x=0 and y=0.

4. **Pull the Door Open:**
   ```python
   pull(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door opens inward, so the robotic arm needs to pull the door to open it.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Unlocking the Door:**
  Since the door is locked and requires a key or lockpick to unlock, the robotic arm would need an additional mechanism or tool to unlock the door. This step is not covered by the basic commands provided.

- **Force Application:**
  The exact amount of force needed to pull the door open is not specified, but the robotic arm should apply a moderate amount of force to ensure the door opens smoothly.

### Summary:
1. **Move to the door handle** to position the robotic arm correctly.
2. **Push the lever handle down** to unlock the door mechanism.
3. **Move to the door edge** to prepare for pulling the door open.
4. **Pull the door open** to complete the task.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will be able to open the door effectively.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle position
move_to(0, 0.6)

# Push the lever handle down
push(handle)

# Move to the door edge position
move_to(0, 0)

# Pull the door open
pull(door)
```
