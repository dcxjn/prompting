6. Is the door hinged on the left or right side?
7. Does the door open inward or outward?
8. What is the weight of the door, and does it require additional force to push or pull it open?
9. Are there any obstacles or objects near the door that the robotic arm needs to avoid?
10. Is there a specific sequence of actions required to unlock or unlatch the door before opening it?
11. What is the material of the door handle, and does it require a specific type of grip to manipulate it?

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door. Each instruction includes a reason for its necessity.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Move to Door Handle Coordinates**
   ```python
   move_to(x, y)
   ```
   **Reason:** Although the exact coordinates are not provided, the robotic arm needs to position itself at the door handle to interact with it. Assuming the coordinates are known or can be determined from the image, this step is essential.

2. **Grab the Door Handle**
   ```python
   grab(door_handle)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a lever-type handle. The robotic arm needs to grab the handle to manipulate it.

3. **Rotate the Handle**
   ```python
   rotate(angle)
   ```
   **Reason:** Lever handles typically need to be rotated to open the door. The exact angle is not provided, but a standard lever handle usually requires a rotation of about 30-45 degrees downward. Adjust the angle as necessary based on the specific handle.

4. **Release the Handle**
   ```python
   release(door_handle)
   ```
   **Reason:** After rotating the handle, the robotic arm should release it to proceed to the next step.

5. **Move to Door Edge**
   ```python
   move_to(x_edge, y_edge)
   ```
   **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to position itself at the edge of the door to push it open. The exact coordinates of the door edge should be determined.

6. **Push the Door**
   ```python
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door opens inward and is hinged on the right side. The robotic arm should push the door to open it. The force required is not specified, so start with a moderate force and adjust as needed.

### Summary of Commands
```python
# Assuming the coordinates of the handle and door edge are known
move_to(x_handle, y_handle)
grab(door_handle)
rotate(30)  # Adjust the angle as necessary
release(door_handle)
move_to(x_edge, y_edge)
push(door)
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Obstacle Detection:** Since there are no visible obstacles, the robotic arm can proceed without additional checks. However, if the environment changes, obstacle detection should be implemented.
- **Force Adjustment:** The force required to push the door open is not specified. The robotic arm should be capable of adjusting the force based on feedback or trial and error.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** If sensors or feedback mechanisms are available, they should be used to confirm that the door has been successfully opened.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to open the door efficiently and safely.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle coordinates
move_to(x_handle, y_handle)

# Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Rotate the handle to open the door
rotate(30)  # Adjust the angle as necessary

# Release the door handle
release(door_handle)

# Move to the edge of the door
move_to(x_edge, y_edge)

# Push the door to open it
push(door)
```

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the center of the image, with the x coordinate being the center of the door and the y coordinate being the center of the door.

2. The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. The height of the door handle from the ground is approximately 3 feet (36 inches or 914 millimeters).

4. The door handle is a lever-type handle.

5. To open the door, you should pull it.

6. To open the door, you should turn the handle counterclockwise.

7. The exact number of degrees needed to turn the handle is not visible in the image, but typically, lever-type handles require a 90-degree turn for a full opening.

8. There is no visible object blocking the door in the image.

9. The amount of force needed to open the door is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a standard door weight.

10. The image does not provide enough information to determine if the door is locked or how to unlock it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(center_x, handle_y)**
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to position itself at the height of the door handle to interact with it. The `center_x` is the x-coordinate of the door's center, and `handle_y` is the y-coordinate at the height of the door handle (approximately 3 feet from the ground).

2. **grab(lever_handle)**
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to grab the lever handle to turn it. This command ensures the arm has a firm grip on the handle.

3. **rotate(-90)**
   - **Reason:** The handle needs to be turned counterclockwise to open the door. A typical lever handle requires a 90-degree turn. The negative sign indicates counterclockwise rotation.

4. **release(lever_handle)**
   - **Reason:** After turning the handle, the robotic arm should release the handle to proceed with the next steps.

5. **move_to(center_x, door_edge_y)**
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to move to the edge of the door to pull it open. The `door_edge_y` is the y-coordinate at the same height as the handle but at the edge of the door.

6. **pull(door)**
   - **Reason:** The door needs to be pulled to open it. This command will apply the necessary force to pull the door open.

7. **move_to(center_x, initial_y)**
   - **Reason:** After pulling the door open, the robotic arm should return to its initial position to avoid obstructing the open door. The `initial_y` is the y-coordinate of the initial position.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each command is designed to ensure the arm interacts correctly with the door handle and applies the necessary actions to open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the height of the door handle
move_to(center_x, handle_y)

# Grab the lever handle
grab(lever_handle)

# Rotate the handle counterclockwise by 90 degrees
rotate(-90)

# Release the lever handle
release(lever_handle)

# Move to the edge of the door at the same height as the handle
move_to(center_x, door_edge_y)

# Pull the door to open it
pull(door)

# Return to the initial position
move_to(center_x, initial_y)
```
