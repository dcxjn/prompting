=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. Does the door handle need to be turned or pushed to open the door?
6. If the door handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
7. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
10. If the door is locked, do you have the key or a way to unlock it?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I'll provide the requested information:

1. **Location of the Door:** The door is located at coordinates (0, 0) on the image.
2. **Type of Door Handle:** The door handle is a knob.
3. **Coordinates of the Door Handle:** The door handle is located at coordinates (0.5, 0.5) on the door.
4. **Direction of Opening:** The door opens towards the viewer.
5. **Mechanism of Opening:** The door handle needs to be pushed to open the door.
6. **Rotation:** No rotation is required; the door simply needs to be pushed.
7. **Obstacles:** There are no objects blocking the door in the image.
8. **Force Required:** A moderate force is needed to push the door open.
9. **Lock Status:** The door appears to be locked, with a keyhole located at coordinates (0.8, 0.8) on the door.
10. **Unlocking Method:** A key would be required to unlock the door, and it should be inserted into the keyhole at the provided coordinates.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided information and the available commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Move to the Keyhole:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.8, 0.8)`
   - **Reason:** The door is locked, and the key needs to be inserted into the keyhole located at coordinates (0.8, 0.8).

2. **Grab the Key:**
   - **Command:** `grab(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to hold the key to insert it into the keyhole.

3. **Insert the Key into the Keyhole:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.8, 0.8)`
   - **Reason:** Ensure the key is precisely positioned to be inserted into the keyhole.

4. **Rotate the Key to Unlock the Door:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)` (assuming a 90-degree turn is needed to unlock)
   - **Reason:** The key needs to be turned to unlock the door.

5. **Release the Key:**
   - **Command:** `release(key)`
   - **Reason:** The key is no longer needed after unlocking the door.

6. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at coordinates (0.5, 0.5), and the robotic arm needs to interact with it to open the door.

7. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to hold the door handle to push it.

8. **Push the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `push(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle needs to be pushed to open the door.

9. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is no longer needed after the door is pushed open.

10. **Move to the Door:**
    - **Command:** `move_to(0, 0)`
    - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm near the door to push it open.

11. **Push the Door:**
    - **Command:** `push(door)`
    - **Reason:** Apply moderate force to push the door open towards the viewer.

### Summary of Commands
1. `move_to(0.8, 0.8)`
2. `grab(key)`
3. `move_to(0.8, 0.8)`
4. `rotate(90)`
5. `release(key)`
6. `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
7. `grab(door_handle)`
8. `push(door_handle)`
9. `release(door_handle)`
10. `move_to(0, 0)`
11. `push(door)`

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully unlock and open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the keyhole
move_to(0.8, 0.8)

# Grab the key
grab(key)

# Insert the key into the keyhole
move_to(0.8, 0.8)

# Rotate the key to unlock the door
rotate(90)

# Release the key
release(key)

# Move to the door handle
move_to(0.5, 0.5)

# Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Push the door handle
push(door_handle)

# Release the door handle
release(door_handle)

# Move to the door
move_to(0, 0)

# Push the door
push(door)
```
