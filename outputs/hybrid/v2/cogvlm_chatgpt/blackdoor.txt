=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates of the door handle.)
2. What kind of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
4. How much force is needed to turn the handle? (Is it easy to turn or does it need a lot of strength?)
5. What is the angle needed to rotate the handle to open the door? (How many degrees should the handle be turned?)
6. Is the door locked? (Do we need to unlock it first?)
7. If the door is locked, where is the key located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates of the key.)
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open? (Is it heavy or light?)
9. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door? (Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?)
10. What is the height of the door handle from the ground? (How high up is the handle?)

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary details to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer these questions, let's examine the image step by step:

1. **Location of the Door Handle:** The door handle is located at the center of the door, approximately 2.5 feet from the ground. The x-coordinate would be 2.5 feet, and the y-coordinate would be at the top of the door, which is around 6 feet from the ground.

2. **Type of Handle:** The door has a lever-style handle, which is typically used for right-handed doors.

3. **Direction of Opening:** The door opens towards the viewer, so the answer would be "towards you."

4. **Force Required:** The door appears to be a standard-sized door, and based on its design, it likely requires a moderate amount of force to open. It's neither extremely heavy nor light, so a reasonable amount of strength would be needed.

5. **Angle to Rotate Handle:** The lever handle is centrally located, so the angle to rotate it to open the door would be 180 degrees, as it's a full rotation from the closed position.

6. **Locked:** From the image, it's not possible to definitively determine if the door is locked, but given the presence of a keyhole and the design of the door, it is plausible that it could be.

7. **Location of Key:** The keyhole is located at the bottom of the door, approximately 3.5 feet from the ground. The x-coordinate would be 3.5 feet, and the y-coordinate would be at the bottom of the door, which is around 4 feet from the ground.

8. **Obstacles:** There doesn't appear to be any immediate obstacles in the way of the door from the perspective of the image.

9. **Height of Handle:** The handle is approximately 4 feet high from the ground.

10. **Additional Information:** The door is set within a brick wall, and there are two wall-mounted lights on either side of the door. The ground appears to be made of concrete or a similar material.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Based on the provided information and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would open the door:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(2.5, 4)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is located at the center of the door, approximately 4 feet from the ground. The robot needs to position itself correctly to interact with the handle.

2. **Rotate the Handle:**
   ```python
   rotate(180)
   ```
   **Reason:** The lever-style handle needs to be rotated 180 degrees to open the door. This step ensures the handle is turned to the correct position.

3. **Push the Door:**
   ```python
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** Since the door opens towards the viewer, the robot needs to push the door after rotating the handle to open it fully.

4. **Check if the Door is Locked:**
   ```python
   # This step assumes the robot has a way to detect if the door is locked.
   if door_is_locked():
       move_to(3.5, 4)
       grab(key)
       move_to(2.5, 3.5)
       insert_key_and_turn()
   ```
   **Reason:** If the door is locked, the robot needs to locate the key, grab it, and use it to unlock the door. The keyhole is approximately 3.5 feet from the ground.

5. **Move Back to the Handle (if needed):**
   ```python
   move_to(2.5, 4)
   rotate(180)
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** After unlocking the door, the robot needs to return to the handle, rotate it again, and push the door to open it.

6. **Ensure the Door is Fully Open:**
   ```python
   move_to(2.5, 4)
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** To ensure the door is fully open, the robot may need to push it further. This step ensures the door is completely open and not partially ajar.

By following these steps, the robot can successfully open the door. Each step is designed to address a specific part of the task, ensuring the door is unlocked (if necessary), the handle is rotated, and the door is pushed open.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(2.5, 4)

# Rotate the handle
rotate(180)

# Push the door
push(door)

# Check if the door is locked
if door_is_locked():
    # Move to the key location
    move_to(3.5, 4)
    # Grab the key
    grab(key)
    # Move to the keyhole
    move_to(2.5, 3.5)
    # Insert key and turn
    insert_key_and_turn()
    # Move back to the handle
    move_to(2.5, 4)
    # Rotate the handle again
    rotate(180)
    # Push the door again
    push(door)

# Ensure the door is fully open
move_to(2.5, 4)
push(door)
```
