=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
6. If the door handle is a knob, do I need to turn it clockwise or counterclockwise to open the door?
7. How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
8. How far does the door need to be pushed or pulled to be fully open?
9. Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
10. Are there any safety precautions I need to be aware of while opening the door?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

Sure, here are the answers to the questions you've asked:

1. Where is the door located?
   The door is located at the following coordinates: X: 0.5 meters, Y: 1.2 meters from the ground level.

2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
   The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
   The door handle is approximately 1.8 meters from the ground.

4. What type of door handle is it?
   The door handle appears to be a lever.

5. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
   You would need to pull the door to open it.

6. If the door handle is a knob, do you need to turn it clockwise or counterclockwise to open the door?
   You would need to turn it clockwise to open the door.

7. How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
   The robotic arm should be able to apply a force of approximately 10 newtons to turn the door handle.

8. How far does the door need to be pushed or pulled to be fully open?
   The door needs to be pushed or pulled approximately 0.5 meters to be fully open.

9. Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
   No, there doesn't appear to be anything blocking the door.

10. Are there any safety precautions I need to be aware of while opening the door?
   It's important to ensure that the door is properly locked after opening and to check if there are any signs of structural issues with the door or its surroundings before proceeding.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the door handle's location:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.5, 1.8)
   ```
   *Reason:* The door handle is located at coordinates (0.5, 1.8) meters. The robotic arm needs to be positioned at this location to interact with the handle.

2. **Grab the door handle:**
   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* The robotic arm needs to secure the door handle to manipulate it.

3. **Rotate the door handle clockwise:**
   ```python
   rotate(90)  # Assuming 90 degrees is sufficient to turn the handle
   ```
   *Reason:* The door handle is a lever that needs to be turned clockwise to unlock the door.

4. **Pull the door to open it:**
   ```python
   pull("door")
   ```
   *Reason:* The door needs to be pulled to open it. The robotic arm should apply a pulling force to the door.

5. **Move back to allow the door to open fully:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.5, 1.2)  # Move back to the original position to avoid obstruction
   ```
   *Reason:* The robotic arm should move back to avoid obstructing the door as it opens.

6. **Release the door handle:**
   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* Once the door is open, the robotic arm can release the door handle.

7. **Ensure the door is fully open:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.5, 1.2)  # Move to a position to check the door
   ```
   *Reason:* The robotic arm should move to a position where it can verify that the door is fully open (0.5 meters as specified).

8. **Check for any structural issues:**
   *Reason:* Before completing the task, the robotic arm should ensure there are no structural issues with the door or its surroundings.

Here is the complete code with comments:

```python
# Step 1: Move to the door handle's location
move_to(0.5, 1.8)  # Position the arm at the door handle

# Step 2: Grab the door handle
grab("door_handle")  # Secure the door handle

# Step 3: Rotate the door handle clockwise
rotate(90)  # Turn the handle clockwise to unlock the door

# Step 4: Pull the door to open it
pull("door")  # Apply a pulling force to open the door

# Step 5: Move back to allow the door to open fully
move_to(0.5, 1.2)  # Move back to avoid obstructing the door

# Step 6: Release the door handle
release("door_handle")  # Release the handle

# Step 7: Ensure the door is fully open
move_to(0.5, 1.2)  # Move to a position to check the door

# Step 8: Check for any structural issues
# (This step would involve some form of sensor check or visual inspection, which is not specified in the commands)
```

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door while ensuring safety and avoiding any obstructions.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
