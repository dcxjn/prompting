=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

To successfully complete the task of opening the door using the robotic arm, you need specific information about the door's characteristics, the environment, and the robotic arm's capabilities. Here are some essential questions to gather the necessary information:

1. What are the coordinates (x, y) of the door handle?
2. What type of door handle is it (e.g., lever, knob, pull)?
3. What is the required angle of rotation to open the door handle?
4. Is the door handle designed to be pushed, pulled, or rotated to open the door?
5. What is the weight and size of the door handle?
6. Are there any obstacles between the robotic arm's current position and the door handle?
7. What is the material of the door handle (e.g., metal, plastic)?
8. What is the force required to operate the door handle?
9. Is the door spring-loaded or does it require continuous force to keep it open?
10. What is the width and height of the door?
11. Does the door open inward or outward?
12. Are there any safety protocols or constraints that the robotic arm must follow while operating the door?
13. What is the current position of the robotic arm?
14. Are there any sensors on the door or handle that the robotic arm can use for feedback?
15. Is there a specific sequence of actions required to open the door (e.g., push then pull, rotate then push)?

These questions will help you gather the necessary information to program the robotic arm to open the door effectively and safely.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. The door handle is a circular knob.
2. The door handle is designed to be pushed to open the door.
3. The door handle is round and requires a force similar to that of a doorknob.
4. It is a single-door handle without a deadbolt.
5. The door handle does not have a latch mechanism.
6. There are no visible obstacles.
7. The door handle appears to be made of metal.
8. Continuous force is required to open the door.
9. The door is a standard-sized door.
10. The door opens inward.
11. The door is a standard blue door.
12. There is no indication of the door being spring-loaded.
13. The current position of the robotic arm is not visible, but it appears to be facing the door handle.
14. There are no visible sensors on the door or handle.
15. There does not seem to be a specific sequence of actions to open the door; however, it's likely that a simple force or push action would suffice to open the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Position the robotic arm near the door handle to ensure it can interact with it. Since the exact coordinates (x, y) are not provided, assume the robotic arm is already facing the door handle and adjust accordingly.

2. **grab(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** Securely grasp the door handle to apply the necessary force to open the door. This step ensures that the robotic arm has a firm grip on the handle.

3. **rotate(angle)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the door handle to the required angle to unlock it. Since the door handle is a circular knob, this step is essential to disengage any internal mechanism that might be holding the door closed. The specific angle isn't provided, but typically, a 90-degree rotation is sufficient for most doorknobs.

4. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** Apply continuous force to push the door open. Since the door opens inward and requires a push action, this step will move the door from its closed position to an open position.

5. **release(door_handle)**
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, release the door handle to complete the task. This step ensures that the robotic arm is free to perform other tasks or return to its initial position.

Here is the step-by-step guide in command format:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - Position the robotic arm near the door handle.

2. **grab(door_handle)**
   - Securely grasp the door handle.

3. **rotate(90)**
   - Rotate the door handle to unlock it.

4. **push(door)**
   - Apply continuous force to push the door open.

5. **release(door_handle)**
   - Release the door handle once the door is open.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the door handle is manipulated correctly and that the door is pushed open as required.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Position the robotic arm near the door handle
move_to(x, y)

# Securely grasp the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Rotate the door handle to unlock it
rotate(90)

# Apply continuous force to push the door open
push(door)

# Release the door handle once the door is open
release(door_handle)
```
