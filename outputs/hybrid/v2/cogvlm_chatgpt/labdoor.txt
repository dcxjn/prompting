=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. If the door has a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please give the angle in degrees.)
6. If the door has a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up to open the door?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, how do I unlock it?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that I need to move first?
10. Is there a specific sequence of actions I need to follow to open the door?

These questions will help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

Sure, let's go through each question step by step:

1. **Where is the door located?**
   The door is located at coordinates (x: 500, y: 1000) on the wall.

2. **Is the door handle a knob or a lever?**
   The door handle appears to be a knob.

3. **Where is the door handle located on the door?**
   The door handle is located at coordinates (x: 750, y: 800) on the door.

4. **Which direction does the door open?**
   The door opens towards the viewer, so it opens in the positive x direction.

5. **If the door has a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door?**
   Since the door handle is a knob, you would typically turn it clockwise to open the door. However, without knowing the orientation of the knob (e.g., whether it's on the left or right side), it's difficult to provide an exact rotation angle.

6. **If the door has a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up to open the door?**
   Without seeing the orientation of the lever, it's challenging to determine whether you need to push or pull it. Typically, if the lever is on the left side of the door, you would pull it to open, and if on the right, you would push it. However, this is a general assumption and may not apply to this specific door.

7. **Is the door locked?**
   The image does not provide clear evidence of the door being locked, so we cannot assume it is locked.

8. **How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?**
   The image does not provide specific details about the amount of force required to open the door. It would depend on the weight and mechanism of the door.

9. **Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that I need to move first?**
   From the image, there doesn't appear to be any visible obstacles in front of the door.

10. **Is there a specific sequence of actions I need to follow to open the door?**
   Based on the information provided, you would typically approach the door, locate the knob, and rotate it clockwise to open. However, without knowing the orientation of the knob and the door's locking mechanism, this is a generalized approach.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **Move to the door handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(750, 800)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is located at coordinates (750, 800) on the door. The robotic arm needs to position itself at the handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the door handle:**
   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```
   **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to securely hold the door handle (knob) to rotate it.

3. **Rotate the door handle clockwise:**
   ```python
   rotate(90)  # Assuming 90 degrees is sufficient to unlock the door
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a knob, and typically, rotating it clockwise will unlock the door. We assume 90 degrees is enough based on common door knob designs.

4. **Release the door handle:**
   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```
   **Reason:** After rotating the knob, the robotic arm needs to release the handle to proceed with opening the door.

5. **Move to the edge of the door:**
   ```python
   move_to(500, 1000)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door is located at coordinates (500, 1000). The robotic arm needs to position itself at the edge of the door to push it open.

6. **Push the door open:**
   ```python
   push("door")
   ```
   **Reason:** The door opens towards the viewer, which means it opens in the positive x direction. The robotic arm needs to push the door to open it.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to open the door successfully.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(750, 800)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door_handle")

# Rotate the door handle clockwise
rotate(90)

# Release the door handle
release("door_handle")

# Move to the edge of the door
move_to(500, 1000)

# Push the door open
push("door")
```
