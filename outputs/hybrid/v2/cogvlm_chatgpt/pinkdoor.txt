=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
2. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Where is the handle located on the door? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. Does the door need to be pushed or pulled to open?
6. If the door has a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please provide the angle in degrees.)
7. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open? (Is it light, medium, or heavy?)
9. Is the door locked? If so, how do I unlock it?
10. Are there any safety precautions I need to take while opening the door?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I will need to provide the coordinates for the door's location and the handle's position. Additionally, I will consider the door's mechanism and any potential obstacles to ensure safe operation.

1. Door Location: The door is located at x: 0.5 meters and y: 2.5 meters from the starting point of the image.

2. Handle Type: The door has a knob as its handle.

3. Handle Location: The knob is located at x: 1.8 meters and y: 1.8 meters from the starting point of the image.

4. Direction of Opening: The door opens towards the viewer.

5. Door Mechanism: The door appears to be a standard hinged door, so it would need to be pushed or pulled to open.

6. Objects Blocking Door: There is no visible object blocking the door.

7. Force Required: The door seems to be of medium weight, so a moderate amount of force would be needed to open it.

8. Locking Mechanism: The door appears to have a standard lock, which can be unlocked by turning the knob.

9. Safety Precautions: It's essential to ensure that the area in front of the door is clear of any obstacles and that no items are in the path of the robotic arm to prevent damage or injury.

10. Unlocking Door: To unlock the door, you would need to turn the knob counterclockwise if it's locked from the inside, or clockwise if it's locked from the outside.

By following these steps, the robotic arm can safely and effectively open the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```move_to(1.8, 1.8)```
   - **Reason:** The handle is located at coordinates (1.8, 1.8). The robotic arm needs to be positioned at the handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   ```grab("door handle")```
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to secure the handle to turn it and unlock the door.

3. **Rotate the Handle:**
   ```rotate(-90)``` (assuming counterclockwise to unlock)
   - **Reason:** The door has a standard lock that can be unlocked by turning the knob counterclockwise. Rotate the handle by 90 degrees to unlock it.

4. **Release the Door Handle:**
   ```release("door handle")```
   - **Reason:** After unlocking the door, the robotic arm needs to release the handle to reposition itself for pushing or pulling the door.

5. **Move to the Door Edge:**
   ```move_to(0.5, 2.5)```
   - **Reason:** The door is located at coordinates (0.5, 2.5). The robotic arm needs to be positioned at the edge of the door to push it open.

6. **Push the Door:**
   ```push("door")```
   - **Reason:** The door opens towards the viewer, so the robotic arm needs to push the door to open it.

7. **Move Back to Starting Position:**
   ```move_to(starting_x, starting_y)``` (replace with actual starting coordinates)
   - **Reason:** After opening the door, the robotic arm should return to its starting position to be ready for the next task or to avoid any obstacles.

By following these steps, the robotic arm can safely and effectively open the door. Each step is designed to ensure that the robotic arm interacts with the door and its handle correctly, applies the necessary force, and avoids any potential obstacles.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(1.8, 1.8)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door handle")

# Rotate the handle to unlock
rotate(-90)

# Release the door handle
release("door handle")

# Move to the door edge
move_to(0.5, 2.5)

# Push the door to open
push("door")

# Move back to starting position
move_to(starting_x, starting_y)  # Replace with actual starting coordinates
```
