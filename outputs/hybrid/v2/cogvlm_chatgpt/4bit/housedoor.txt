=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
2. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Where is the handle located on the door? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
4. In which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. Does the handle need to be turned, pushed, or pulled to open the door?
6. If the handle needs to be turned, by how many degrees should it be rotated?
7. Is the door locked? (Do we need to unlock it first?)
8. If the door is locked, where is the keyhole located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
9. What is the size and shape of the handle? (Is it round, flat, etc.?)
10. How much force is needed to turn, push, or pull the handle?
11. Once the handle is operated, do we need to push or pull the door to open it? (Specify which action and the direction.)
12. How wide is the door? (Do we need to move the robotic arm to a different position after opening it?)
13. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

Certainly! Let's go through each question step by step:

1. **Location of the Door**: The door is located at the coordinates (x: 0, y: 0), which means it is at the very center of the image.

2. **Type of Handle**: The door has a knob handle, which can be identified by its round shape.

3. **Handle Location on the Door**: The handle is located at the coordinates (x: 0.5, y: 0.5), which is slightly to the left and above the center of the door.

4. **Direction of Opening**: The door opens towards the viewer, as indicated by the orientation of the door's panels.

5. **Unlocking**: The door appears to be locked, as there is no visible keyhole or mechanism to open it without a key.

6. **Handle Operation**: The handle does not need to be turned; it can be pushed or pulled to open the door.

7. **Force Required**: The door can be opened with a moderate amount of force, as it doesn't appear to be very heavy.

8. **Size and Shape of the Handle**: The handle is round and has a smooth surface.

9. **Opening Direction**: Once the handle is operated, the door needs to be pulled to open it.

10. **Width of the Door**: The door is wide enough for the robotic arm to move through without obstruction.

11. **Obstacles**: There are no visible obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm.

12. **Width of the Arm**: The robotic arm is wide enough to fit through the door without needing to move to a different position.

13. **Movement**: The robotic arm can move freely within the space provided by the door and the surrounding area.

These details should help the robotic arm successfully open the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

1. **Move to the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
   - **Reason**: The handle is located at coordinates (0.5, 0.5), so the robotic arm needs to move to this position to interact with the handle.

2. **Grab the Handle**
   - **Command**: `grab(handle)`
   - **Reason**: The handle needs to be grabbed to apply the necessary force to open the door.

3. **Pull the Handle**
   - **Command**: `pull(handle)`
   - **Reason**: The door opens towards the viewer, so the handle needs to be pulled to open the door.

4. **Release the Handle**
   - **Command**: `release(handle)`
   - **Reason**: Once the door is open, the handle can be released.

5. **Move Back to Initial Position**
   - **Command**: `move_to(0, 0)`
   - **Reason**: Moving back to the initial position ensures the robotic arm is out of the way and ready for any further commands.

Here is the complete sequence of commands:

1. `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
2. `grab(handle)`
3. `pull(handle)`
4. `release(handle)`
5. `move_to(0, 0)`

This sequence ensures that the robotic arm successfully opens the door by moving to the handle, pulling it to open the door, and then returning to its initial position.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0.5, 0.5)

# Grab the handle
grab(handle)

# Pull the handle to open the door
pull(handle)

# Release the handle
release(handle)

# Move back to the initial position
move_to(0, 0)
```
