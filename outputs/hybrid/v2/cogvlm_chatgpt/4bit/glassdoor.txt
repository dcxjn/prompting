=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it push open or pull open?)
5. If the door handle is a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please give the angle in degrees)
6. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
7. Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
9. Is the door handle at a comfortable height for the robotic arm to reach?
10. Are there any specific safety precautions I need to take while opening the door?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I will need to analyze the image you provided and provide the requested information:

1. Where is the door located?
   The door is located at the intersection of the wall and the floor, as seen in the image. The exact coordinates are not provided, but visually, it appears to be roughly in the center of the image.

2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
   The door handle in the image appears to be a knob. It is singular and lacks the elongated design typical of levers.

3. Where is the door handle located on the door?
   The door handle is located on the right side of the door, as viewed from the perspective of the image. It is positioned near the top edge of the door, which is the standard location for a door knob.

4. Which direction does the door open?
   The door opens to the left when viewed from the perspective of the image. This is determined by the orientation of the door frame and the placement of the door handle.

5. If the door handle is a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door?
   The image does not provide the exact rotation angle needed to open the door. However, typically, door knobs are turned clockwise to open and counterclockwise to close. Without a clear indication of the door's orientation (e.g., whether it opens to the left or right), it's challenging to determine the rotation direction.

6. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
   The image does not provide specific information on the force required to open the door. However, standard door knobs typically require a moderate amount of force, which can vary based on the door's weight and construction.

7. Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
   From the image provided, there doesn't appear to be anything blocking the door. The area in front of the door looks clear.

8. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
   The image does not provide the exact height of the door handle from the ground. However, standard door knobs are typically installed at a height that is easily accessible, often between 36 and 48 inches from the floor.

9. Is the door handle at a comfortable height for the robotic arm to reach?
   Without knowing the exact dimensions of the robotic arm and the door's height, it's difficult to determine if the door handle is at a comfortable height. However, if the robotic arm is designed to reach standard door heights, then it should be able to access the door handle.

10. Are there any specific safety precautions I need to take while opening the door?
   Based on the image alone, there are no visible safety precautions that need to be taken to open the door. However, it's always important to ensure that the door is unlocked and that there are no obstructions before attempting to open it with a robotic arm or any other tool.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Based on the provided information and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to position itself at the door handle to interact with it. Since the exact coordinates are not provided, we'll assume the door handle is at a standard height and position relative to the door's center.
   - **Assumed Coordinates:** If the door is roughly centered in the image and the handle is on the right side near the top, we can estimate the coordinates. For example, if the image is 1000x1000 pixels, the handle might be around (750, 250).

   ```python
   move_to(750, 250)
   ```

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(object)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to secure the door handle to turn it.
   - **Object:** `door_handle`

   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```

3. **Rotate the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** To open the door, the knob needs to be turned. Typically, door knobs are turned clockwise to open.
   - **Angle:** Assuming a standard rotation of 90 degrees clockwise.

   ```python
   rotate(90)
   ```

4. **Pull the Door Open:**
   - **Command:** `pull(object)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door opens to the left, the robotic arm needs to pull the door towards itself to open it.
   - **Object:** `door`

   ```python
   pull("door")
   ```

5. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(object)`
   - **Reason:** After the door is opened, the robotic arm can release the door handle.
   - **Object:** `door_handle`

   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```

### Summary of Commands:
1. `move_to(750, 250)`
2. `grab("door_handle")`
3. `rotate(90)`
4. `pull("door")`
5. `release("door_handle")`

### Reasons for Each Step:
1. **Move to the Door Handle:** To position the robotic arm correctly to interact with the door handle.
2. **Grab the Door Handle:** To secure the handle for turning.
3. **Rotate the Door Handle:** To unlock the door by turning the knob.
4. **Pull the Door Open:** To open the door by pulling it towards the robotic arm.
5. **Release the Door Handle:** To free the robotic arm after the door is opened.

This sequence ensures that the robotic arm can successfully open the door from its initial position as the viewer.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(750, 250)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door_handle")

# Rotate the door handle to unlock
rotate(90)

# Pull the door open
pull("door")

# Release the door handle
release("door_handle")
```
