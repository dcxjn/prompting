=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. Does the door open by pulling or pushing?
6. How much force is needed to turn the handle?
7. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
8. What is the angle of rotation needed to turn the door handle?
9. Is there any obstacle in front of the door that the robotic arm needs to avoid?
10. Is the door locked? If so, how can it be unlocked?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

Certainly! Let's break down each question step by step:

1. **Location of the Door**: The door is located at coordinates (x, y) = (0, 0), which is typically the center of the image.

2. **Side of the Handle**: The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. **Height of the Handle from the Ground**: The door handle is approximately 1.5 meters from the ground.

4. **Type of Handle**: The door has a knob as its handle.

5. **Opening Direction**: The door opens by pulling.

6. **Force Needed to Turn the Handle**: The robotic arm would need to exert a force of approximately 10 Newtons to turn the knob.

7. **Force Needed to Open the Door**: The robotic arm would need to apply a force of around 50 Newtons to pull the door open.

8. **Angle of Rotation Needed to Turn the Handle**: The robotic arm would need to rotate the knob by approximately 45 degrees.

9. **Obstacles in Front of the Door**: There is a potted plant in front of the door, which the robotic arm would need to avoid.

10. **Locked**: The door appears to be locked, so it would need a key to unlock it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Move to the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `move_to(0, 1.5)`
   - **Reason**: The door handle is located at coordinates (0, 1.5) meters. Moving to this position allows the robotic arm to reach the handle.

2. **Rotate to Align with the Handle**
   - **Command**: `rotate(45)`
   - **Reason**: The door handle is a knob that needs to be turned by 45 degrees to unlock the door. Rotating the arm ensures it is aligned properly to grip and turn the knob.

3. **Grab the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `grab(knob)`
   - **Reason**: Grabbing the knob is necessary to apply the force needed to turn it.

4. **Turn the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `rotate(45)`
   - **Reason**: Rotating the knob by 45 degrees will unlock the door.

5. **Release the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `release(knob)`
   - **Reason**: Releasing the knob is necessary to reposition the arm for pulling the door open.

6. **Move to a Position to Pull the Door**
   - **Command**: `move_to(-0.5, 1.5)`
   - **Reason**: Moving slightly to the left (-0.5) ensures the arm is in a better position to pull the door open without obstruction.

7. **Grab the Door Handle Again**
   - **Command**: `grab(knob)`
   - **Reason**: Grabbing the knob again is necessary to apply the pulling force to open the door.

8. **Pull the Door Open**
   - **Command**: `pull(knob)`
   - **Reason**: Pulling the knob with a force of 50 Newtons will open the door.

9. **Release the Door Handle**
   - **Command**: `release(knob)`
   - **Reason**: Releasing the knob after pulling ensures the door remains open and the arm can move away.

10. **Move Back to Avoid Obstacle**
    - **Command**: `move_to(-1, 1.5)`
    - **Reason**: Moving back to (-1, 1.5) ensures the arm avoids the potted plant in front of the door and clears the path.

### Summary:
- The robotic arm first moves to the door handle's location and aligns itself to grab and turn the knob.
- It then turns the knob to unlock the door, releases the knob, and repositions itself to pull the door open.
- Finally, it pulls the door open and moves back to avoid any obstacles.

By following these steps, the robotic arm can successfully open the door while avoiding any obstacles in its path.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(0, 1.5)

# Rotate to align with the handle
rotate(45)

# Grab the door handle
grab(knob)

# Turn the door handle
rotate(45)

# Release the door handle
release(knob)

# Move to a position to pull the door
move_to(-0.5, 1.5)

# Grab the door handle again
grab(knob)

# Pull the door open
pull(knob)

# Release the door handle
release(knob)

# Move back to avoid obstacle
move_to(-1, 1.5)
```
