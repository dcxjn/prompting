=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which way does the door open? (Does it push open or pull open?)
5. If the door handle is a knob, do I need to turn it? If yes, by how many degrees?
6. If the door handle is a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up?
7. Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to open the door? (Is it heavy or light?)
9. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
10. Do I need to grab and turn the key to unlock the door? If yes, by how many degrees?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I will provide the coordinates and details you need to interact with the door using a robotic arm:

1. **Location of the Door:** The door is located at the center of the image, with its base at (0, 0) and its top at (1, 0).

2. **Type of Door Handle:** The door handle appears to be a lever, as there is no visible knob and the handle is elongated.

3. **Coordinates of the Door Handle:** The door handle is located at (0.5, 0.5).

4. **Direction of Opening:** The door appears to open towards the right side of the image, so it likely pushes open.

5. **Force Required:** The door seems to be of standard weight, so a moderate force would be needed to open it. However, without additional context, it's hard to determine the exact amount of force.

6. **Locking Mechanism:** There is a keyhole visible on the right side of the door, located at (1, 0.5). This suggests that a key is needed to unlock the door.

7. **Unlocking Procedure:** Since there is a keyhole, it would be logical to assume that one would need to insert a key into the keyhole to unlock the door.

8. **Blockages:** There are no visible obstructions in the image that would need to be moved to open the door.

9. **Key Location:** The keyhole is located on the right side of the door, just below the sign.

10. **Unlocking Procedure:** To unlock the door, one would need to insert a key into the keyhole located at (1, 0.5) and turn it to the right, assuming the keyhole is on the right side of the door handle.

These details should help the robotic arm successfully interact with the door handle and unlock the door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided information and the available commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Move to the Keyhole:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(1, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The keyhole is located at (1, 0.5). The robotic arm needs to be positioned here to insert the key and unlock the door.

2. **Grab the Key:**
   - **Command:** `grab(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to grab the key to insert it into the keyhole.

3. **Insert the Key into the Keyhole:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(1, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** Ensure the key is properly aligned with the keyhole for insertion.

4. **Turn the Key to Unlock:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** Turn the key 90 degrees to the right to unlock the door.

5. **Release the Key:**
   - **Command:** `release(key)`
   - **Reason:** After unlocking, the key can be released.

6. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at (0.5, 0.5). The robotic arm needs to be positioned here to interact with the handle.

7. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to grab the handle to push the door open.

8. **Push the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `push(handle)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door opens towards the right, pushing the handle will open the door.

9. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(handle)`
   - **Reason:** After pushing the door open, the handle can be released.

### Summary of Commands:
1. `move_to(1, 0.5)`
2. `grab(key)`
3. `move_to(1, 0.5)`
4. `rotate(90)`
5. `release(key)`
6. `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
7. `grab(handle)`
8. `push(handle)`
9. `release(handle)`

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully unlock and open the door.
