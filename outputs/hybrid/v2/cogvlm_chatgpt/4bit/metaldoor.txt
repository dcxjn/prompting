=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure, here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the door handle.)
2. What type of door handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. In which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
4. If the door has a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please provide the angle in degrees.)
5. Is the door currently locked? (Yes or No)
6. If the door is locked, where is the key located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of the key.)
7. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open? (Please provide a rough estimate if possible.)
8. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first? (Yes or No)
9. If there are obstacles, where are they located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates of each obstacle.)
10. Is there a specific sequence of actions required to open the door? (For example, do I need to turn the knob before pulling the door?)

These questions should help gather all the necessary information to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. Where is the door located?
   - x coordinate: 0.5 meters from the wall
   - y coordinate: 2.5 meters from the ground

2. What type of door handle does the door have?
   - The door has a lever handle

3. In which direction does the door open?
   - The door opens away from the viewer

4. If the door has a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door?
   - The door does not have a knob; it has a lever handle. Therefore, no rotation is needed.

5. Is the door currently locked?
   - No, the door is not locked.

6. If the door is locked, where is the key located?
   - The door is not locked, so there is no key needed to open it.

7. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
   - A moderate amount of force would be needed to push or pull the door open. However, without exact measurements, it's hard to provide a precise number.

8. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first?
   - No, there are no obstacles in the way of the door.

9. If there are obstacles, where are they located?
   - There are no obstacles in the way of the door.

10. Is there a specific sequence of actions required to open the door?
   - No specific sequence is required; simply approach the door and use the robotic arm to grasp the lever handle and pull the door open.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 2.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located 0.5 meters from the wall and 2.5 meters from the ground. Moving to this position will allow the robotic arm to reach the handle.

2. **Grab the Lever Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(lever_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Grabbing the lever handle is necessary to manipulate it and open the door.

3. **Pull the Lever Handle Down:**
   - **Command:** `pull(lever_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Lever handles typically need to be pulled down to disengage the latch mechanism inside the door.

4. **Move Back Slightly to Create Space:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 2.0)`
   - **Reason:** Moving back slightly will create space for the door to open away from the viewer. This step ensures that the robotic arm is not in the way of the door's path.

5. **Push the Door Open:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door opens away from the viewer, pushing it will open the door. The robotic arm needs to apply a moderate amount of force to push the door open.

6. **Release the Lever Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(lever_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robotic arm can release the lever handle as it is no longer needed to keep the door open.

Here is the complete sequence of commands:

1. `move_to(0.5, 2.5)`
2. `grab(lever_handle)`
3. `pull(lever_handle)`
4. `move_to(0.5, 2.0)`
5. `push(door)`
6. `release(lever_handle)`

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle position
move_to(0.5, 2.5)

# Grab the lever handle
grab(lever_handle)

# Pull the lever handle down
pull(lever_handle)

# Move back slightly to create space for the door to open
move_to(0.5, 2.0)

# Push the door open
push(door)

# Release the lever handle
release(lever_handle)
```
