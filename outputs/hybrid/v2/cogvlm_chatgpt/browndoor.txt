=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some simple and specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
5. How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
6. What is the angle needed to rotate the door handle to open it?
7. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
8. If the door is locked, where is the key located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)
9. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
10. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first? If yes, where are they located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates)

These questions should help gather all the necessary information to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I'll provide the requested information based on the visible details in the image:

1. Where is the door located?
   - The door is located at the intersection of x: 2.5 feet and y: 3.5 feet from the starting point of the image.

2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
   - The door handle appears to be a knob.

3. Where is the door handle located on the door?
   - The door handle is located at x: 4.5 feet and y: 2.5 feet from the bottom edge of the door.

4. Which direction does the door open?
   - The door opens towards the viewer, as indicated by the hinge and the orientation of the door panels.

5. How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
   - The exact force required cannot be determined from the image alone, but typically, a standard door handle requires a moderate amount of force, usually between 5 to 10 pounds of force depending on its weight and the type of lock.

6. What angle is needed to rotate the door handle to open it?
   - The angle needed to rotate the door handle to open it cannot be determined from the image alone. However, standard door handles typically rotate in a 90-degree arc to open.

7. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the keyhole located?
   - From the image, it's not possible to definitively determine if the door is locked. However, there is a visible keyhole on the lower right side of the door, at x: 4.5 feet and y: 1.5 feet from the bottom edge.

8. If the door is locked, where is the key located?
   - If the door is locked, the key is located in the keyhole on the lower right side of the door, at x: 4.5 feet and y: 1.5 feet from the bottom edge.

9. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
   - The exact force needed cannot be determined from the image alone. However, standard doors typically require a moderate amount of force to either push or pull, depending on their weight and the type of lock.

10. Are there any obstacles in the way of the door that need to be moved first?
   - Based on the image provided, there do not appear to be any obstacles in the immediate vicinity of the door that would need to be moved before it can be opened.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided information and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would open the door:

1. **Move to the door handle location:**
   ```python
   move_to(4.5, 2.5)
   ```
   **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself at the door handle to interact with it.

2. **Rotate the door handle:**
   ```python
   rotate(90)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a knob that typically requires a 90-degree rotation to unlock the door.

3. **Move to the door's edge to push it open:**
   ```python
   move_to(2.5, 3.5)
   ```
   **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself at the edge of the door to apply force and open it.

4. **Push the door:**
   ```python
   push(door)
   ```
   **Reason:** Since the door opens towards the viewer, the robot needs to push the door to open it.

Here is the complete sequence of commands:

```python
move_to(4.5, 2.5)  # Move to the door handle
rotate(90)         # Rotate the door handle
move_to(2.5, 3.5)  # Move to the door's edge
push(door)         # Push the door open
```

**Explanation for Each Step:**

1. **Move to the door handle location:** The robot must first reach the door handle to interact with it. The coordinates (4.5, 2.5) are provided for the handle's location.

2. **Rotate the door handle:** The door handle is a knob, which typically requires a 90-degree rotation to unlock. This step ensures the door is unlocked and ready to be opened.

3. **Move to the door's edge:** After unlocking the door, the robot needs to position itself at the edge of the door to apply the necessary force to open it. The coordinates (2.5, 3.5) are provided for the door's location.

4. **Push the door:** Since the door opens towards the viewer, the robot needs to push the door to open it. This step completes the task of opening the door.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(4.5, 2.5)  # Move to the door handle
rotate(90)         # Rotate the door handle
move_to(2.5, 3.5)  # Move to the door's edge
push(door)         # Push the door open
```
