=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

To successfully complete the task of opening the door using the robotic arm, you need to gather specific information about the door, its handle, and the environment. Here are some precise questions to obtain the necessary information:

1. What are the exact coordinates (x, y) of the door handle?
2. What type of handle does the door have (e.g., knob, lever, pull handle)?
3. If the handle is a knob or lever, what is the required angle of rotation to open the door?
4. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
5. Is the door hinged on the left or right side?
6. Does the door open inward or outward?
7. What is the weight of the door, and does it require any additional force to push or pull it open?
8. Are there any obstacles or objects near the door that the robotic arm needs to avoid?
9. Is the door currently locked, and if so, what is the mechanism to unlock it?
10. What is the material of the door handle (e.g., metal, plastic) to determine the appropriate grip strength?
11. Are there any sensors or feedback mechanisms on the door to confirm it is fully open?

These questions will help ensure you have all the necessary details to program the robotic arm to open the door efficiently and safely.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To successfully open the door using the robotic arm, let's go through the steps and answer each question:

1. **Coordinates of the Door Handle:** The door handle is located at approximately (x, y) = (0.5, 0.5) meters from the bottom edge of the door, measured from the center of the door panels.

2. **Type of Handle:** The door has a knob handle.

3. **Angle of Rotation to Open:** The door appears to be a standard swing door, which typically opens by rotating around its hinge. The angle of rotation to open would be 180 degrees.

4. **Height of the Door Handle from the Ground:** The door handle is approximately 1.2 meters from the ground.

5. **Hinge Side:** The door is hinged on the right side.

6. **Opening Direction:** The door opens inward.

7. **Weight of the Door:** Without specific measurements or additional context, it's not possible to accurately determine the door's weight. However, typical wooden doors of this size and thickness can weigh anywhere from 20 to 50 kilograms, depending on the quality of the wood and the door's size.

8. **Obstacles:** From the image, it appears there are no immediate obstacles near the door that the robotic arm would need to avoid.

9. **Unlocking Mechanism:** The image does not provide a clear view of the door's locking mechanism, so it's not possible to determine how it's locked or how to unlock it.

10. **Material of the Door Handle:** The door handle appears to be made of metal, which would require a firm grip to turn.

11. **Feedback Mechanism:** There is no visible feedback mechanism on the door in the image, so it's not possible to confirm if the door is fully open upon contact.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.5, 1.2)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is located at coordinates (0.5, 1.2) meters. Moving the robotic arm to this position ensures it is aligned with the handle.

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```
   **Reason:** The door handle is a knob made of metal, requiring a firm grip to turn. The `grab` command ensures the robotic arm securely holds the handle.

3. **Rotate the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   rotate(180)
   ```
   **Reason:** The door knob needs to be turned 180 degrees to open the door. The `rotate` command will achieve this.

4. **Pull the Door Open:**
   ```python
   pull("door")
   ```
   **Reason:** The door opens inward. After turning the knob, the robotic arm needs to pull the door to open it. The `pull` command will handle this action.

5. **Release the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```
   **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robotic arm should release the door handle to complete the task. The `release` command will ensure the handle is let go.

### Summary of Steps and Reasons

1. **Move to (0.5, 1.2):** Position the arm at the door handle's location.
2. **Grab the Door Handle:** Securely grip the metal knob.
3. **Rotate 180 Degrees:** Turn the knob to unlock the door.
4. **Pull the Door:** Open the door inward.
5. **Release the Handle:** Let go of the handle once the door is open.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will efficiently and effectively open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle's position
move_to(0.5, 1.2)

# Securely grip the door handle
grab("door_handle")

# Turn the door handle 180 degrees
rotate(180)

# Pull the door to open it
pull("door")

# Release the door handle
release("door_handle")
```
