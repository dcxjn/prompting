=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it push open or pull open?)
5. If the door handle is a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please give the angle in degrees.)
6. How high off the ground is the door handle? (Please give the height in units.)
7. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Is the door locked? If so, where is the keyhole located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
10. What is the size and shape of the door handle? (Please describe it or provide dimensions.)

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. The door is located at coordinates (x, y) = (0.5, 0.5) on the wall.
2. The door handle is a lever, so it is not a knob.
3. The door handle is located at coordinates (x, y) = (0.4, 0.9) on the door.
4. The door opens by pushing, so the direction is towards the camera.
5. The door handle is a lever, so it doesn't rotate; instead, you would need to apply force to move the door.
6. The door handle is 0.3 units off the ground.
7. There is no object blocking the door in the image.
8. The door appears to be locked, and the keyhole is located at coordinates (x, y) = (0.6, 0.8) on the door.
9. The door requires a significant amount of force to open.
10. The door handle is rectangular and appears to be made of metal, with dimensions of approximately 0.2 units in width and 0.4 units in height.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the keyhole:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.6, 0.8)
   ```
   *Reason:* The door is locked, so the first step is to unlock it by interacting with the keyhole.

2. **Insert and turn the key (assuming the robot has a key or a mechanism to unlock):**
   ```python
   rotate(90)  # Assuming a 90-degree turn is needed to unlock
   ```
   *Reason:* Turning the key will unlock the door, allowing it to be opened.

3. **Move to the door handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.4, 0.9)
   ```
   *Reason:* The door handle is a lever, and the robot needs to interact with it to open the door.

4. **Grab the door handle:**
   ```python
   grab("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* Grabbing the handle is necessary to apply force and push the door open.

5. **Push the door handle down:**
   ```python
   push("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* Pushing the lever down will disengage the latch mechanism, allowing the door to be pushed open.

6. **Move to the door itself to push it open:**
   ```python
   move_to(0.5, 0.5)
   ```
   *Reason:* The robot needs to be positioned at the door to apply force and push it open.

7. **Push the door:**
   ```python
   push("door")
   ```
   *Reason:* The door opens by pushing, so applying force in the correct direction will open it.

8. **Release the door handle:**
   ```python
   release("door_handle")
   ```
   *Reason:* Once the door is open, the robot can release the handle.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully unlock and open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the keyhole
move_to(0.6, 0.8)

# Insert and turn the key
rotate(90)  # Turn key 90 degrees to unlock

# Move to the door handle
move_to(0.4, 0.9)

# Grab the door handle
grab("door_handle")

# Push the door handle down
push("door_handle")

# Move to the door itself to push it open
move_to(0.5, 0.5)

# Push the door
push("door")

# Release the door handle
release("door_handle")
```
