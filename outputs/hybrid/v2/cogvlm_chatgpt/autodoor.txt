=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
5. In which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
6. Do you need to turn the handle to open the door? If yes, by how many degrees?
7. Is there an object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Is the door locked? If yes, where is the key or how can it be unlocked?
10. Are there any safety precautions to consider while opening the door?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the x and y coordinates.)
   The door is located at approximately (0, 0) on the x and y coordinates system, as it is the center of the image.

2. Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
   The door handle is on the right side of the door.

3. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
   The door handle is approximately 2.5 meters from the ground.

4. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
   It appears to be a lever.

5. In which direction does the door open? It opens towards you.

6. Do you need to turn the handle to open the door? No, there is no need to turn the lever; it can be pulled directly.

7. Is there an object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
   No, there is no object blocking the door.

8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
   The door seems to be a standard size and can be opened with a moderate amount of force, possibly around 20-30 Newtons.

9. Is the door locked? No, there is no visible lock or keyhole on the door.

10. Are there any safety precautions to consider while opening the door?
   Since there is no visible lock and the door seems to be a standard design, there are no specific safety precautions required for opening it.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   move_to(0, 2.5)
   ```
   *Reason:* The door handle is located at (0, 2.5) meters. Moving to this position allows the robotic arm to reach the handle.

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   grab('door_handle')
   ```
   *Reason:* Grabbing the door handle ensures that the robotic arm has a firm grip on the lever, which is necessary to pull it.

3. **Pull the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   pull('door_handle')
   ```
   *Reason:* Since the door handle is a lever and it opens towards you, pulling the handle will disengage the latch mechanism, allowing the door to open.

4. **Move Back Slightly to Open the Door:**
   ```python
   move_to(-0.5, 2.5)
   ```
   *Reason:* Moving back slightly (e.g., 0.5 meters) will help in pulling the door open towards the robotic arm. This step ensures that the door starts to open.

5. **Release the Door Handle:**
   ```python
   release('door_handle')
   ```
   *Reason:* Once the door is partially open, the robotic arm can release the handle to avoid unnecessary strain and to prepare for the next action.

6. **Move to the Edge of the Door:**
   ```python
   move_to(0, 1.25)
   ```
   *Reason:* Moving to the edge of the door at a lower height (1.25 meters) allows the robotic arm to push the door further open if needed.

7. **Push the Door:**
   ```python
   push('door')
   ```
   *Reason:* Pushing the door from the edge ensures that it opens fully. This step is necessary to ensure the door is completely open and not just ajar.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure the task is completed efficiently and safely.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle position
move_to(0, 2.5)

# Grab the door handle
grab('door_handle')

# Pull the door handle to disengage the latch
pull('door_handle')

# Move back slightly to start opening the door
move_to(-0.5, 2.5)

# Release the door handle
release('door_handle')

# Move to the edge of the door at a lower height
move_to(0, 1.25)

# Push the door to open it fully
push('door')
```
