=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

 USER:
        Given the task: open the door, describe all RELEVANT features in the image.
        Be as detailed and specific as possible. Are these features applicable to the task?
        Give your observations in the format of bullet points.

ASSISTANT: The image shows a set of double doors with several relevant features for opening the door:

- **Door Handles**: There are two door handles, one on each side of the doors. These are used to open the doors.
- **Door Locks**: There are two locking mechanisms visible, one on each side of the doors. These are used to secure the doors when they are closed.
- **Door Hinges**: The doors are hinged at the top, which means they open by pivoting around a central point.
- **Door Glass**: There is a glass window on the upper half of each door. This allows visibility into the room beyond the doors.
- **Door Frame**: The doors are framed by a metal structure that provides support and protection.
- **Door Signage**: There are signs on the doors, which may indicate rules or regulations for entering or exiting the area.
- **Door Access Controls**: There are access control devices, which could be card readers or other security measures, to control entry and exit.
- **Door Seals**: There are seals around the edges of the doors, which are used to prevent air or light from entering or exiting the room.
- **Door Sensors**: There may be sensors or other detection devices on the doors to monitor access or to automatically open the doors in case of emergencies.
- **Door Locking Mechanisms**: There are locking mechanisms visible, which are used to secure the doors when they are closed.
- **Door Opening Mechanisms**: There may be hidden mechanisms or buttons for opening the doors, which are not visible in the image.
- **Door Access Controls**: There may be access control devices, such as card readers or other security measures, to control entry and exit.

These features are all relevant to opening the door, as they are the components that make up the door system and are necessary for proper operation.

=== HUMAN INSTRUCTIONS ===

 To open the door, follow these detailed step-by-step instructions, each linked to the relevant observation from the image:

1. **Observation: Door Handles**
   - **Instruction**: Approach the door and grasp the door handle on the side of the door you wish to open.

2. **Observation: Door Locks**
   - **Instruction**: Check if the door is locked. If there is a locking mechanism, ensure it is in the unlocked position. This may involve turning a key or manipulating a thumb turn.

3. **Observation: Door Access Controls**
   - **Instruction**: If there is an access control device such as a card reader, use the appropriate access card or input the necessary code to unlock the door.

4. **Observation: Door Hinges**
   - **Instruction**: Note the position of the door hinges to understand the direction in which the door will open (pivoting around the central point).

5. **Observation: Door Handles**
   - **Instruction**: Once the door is unlocked, pull or push the door handle to open the door. The direction will depend on the door's design (pull if the door opens towards you, push if it opens away from you).

6. **Observation: Door Frame**
   - **Instruction**: Ensure that you are clear of the door frame as you open the door to avoid any obstruction.

7. **Observation: Door Glass**
   - **Instruction**: Use the glass window to check for any obstacles or people on the other side of the door before fully opening it.

8. **Observation: Door Sensors**
   - **Instruction**: Be aware of any door sensors that might automatically open the door or trigger an alarm if the door is opened without proper authorization.

9. **Observation: Door Seals**
   - **Instruction**: As you open the door, be mindful of the door seals to ensure they do not get damaged or obstruct the door's movement.

10. **Observation: Door Signage**
    - **Instruction**: Read any signage on the door for additional instructions or warnings about opening the door.

By following these steps and linking each instruction to the relevant observation, you can successfully open the door while ensuring all necessary precautions are taken.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 To program the robotic arm to open the door using the provided commands, follow these detailed steps, each linked to the relevant human instruction:

1. **Observation: Door Handles**
   - **Human Instruction**: Approach the door and grasp the door handle on the side of the door you wish to open.
   - **Robot Command**: `move_to(handle_x, handle_y)` to position the robotic arm near the door handle.

2. **Observation: Door Locks**
   - **Human Instruction**: Check if the door is locked. If there is a locking mechanism, ensure it is in the unlocked position. This may involve turning a key or manipulating a thumb turn.
   - **Robot Command**: If the door is locked, use `move_to(lock_x, lock_y)` to position the arm near the lock, then use `rotate(angle)` to unlock it.

3. **Observation: Door Access Controls**
   - **Human Instruction**: If there is an access control device such as a card reader, use the appropriate access card or input the necessary code to unlock the door.
   - **Robot Command**: `move_to(access_control_x, access_control_y)` to position the arm near the access control device, then use `push(access_control)` or `pull(access_control)` as needed to interact with it.

4. **Observation: Door Hinges**
   - **Human Instruction**: Note the position of the door hinges to understand the direction in which the door will open (pivoting around the central point).
   - **Robot Command**: No specific command needed, but ensure the robot is aware of the door's pivot direction for subsequent steps.

5. **Observation: Door Handles**
   - **Human Instruction**: Once the door is unlocked, pull or push the door handle to open the door.
   - **Robot Command**: `grab(handle)` to grasp the door handle, then use `pull(handle)` if the door opens towards the robot or `push(handle)` if the door opens away from the robot.

6. **Observation: Door Frame**
   - **Human Instruction**: Ensure that you are clear of the door frame as you open the door to avoid any obstruction.
   - **Robot Command**: `move_to(clear_position_x, clear_position_y)` to ensure the robotic arm is positioned clear of the door frame.

7. **Observation: Door Glass**
   - **Human Instruction**: Use the glass window to check for any obstacles or people on the other side of the door before fully opening it.
   - **Robot Command**: This step may not be directly applicable to the robotic arm unless it has visual sensors. If it does, use the sensors to check for obstacles.

8. **Observation: Door Sensors**
   - **Human Instruction**: Be aware of any door sensors that might automatically open the door or trigger an alarm if the door is opened without proper authorization.
   - **Robot Command**: Ensure the robotic arm does not trigger any sensors. If sensors are present, `move_to(sensor_x, sensor_y)` to disable or bypass them if necessary.

9. **Observation: Door Seals**
   - **Human Instruction**: As you open the door, be mindful of the door seals to ensure they do not get damaged or obstruct the door's movement.
   - **Robot Command**: `move_to(seal_x, seal_y)` to ensure the robotic arm is aware of the door seals and does not damage them during operation.

10. **Observation: Door Signage**
    - **Human Instruction**: Read any signage on the door for additional instructions or warnings about opening the door.
    - **Robot Command**: This step may not be directly applicable to the robotic arm unless it has the capability to read and interpret text.

By following these steps and using the appropriate commands, the robotic arm can successfully open the door while ensuring all necessary precautions are taken.
