=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

 - The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.
- The door is equipped with hinges on the top and bottom, allowing it to swing open and closed.
- The door is set within a white trimmed frame.
- The floor appears to be made of light-colored tiles.
- There is a small object, possibly a shoe, visible at the bottom left corner of the image.
- The door's surface shows signs of wear and tear, with some scuff marks and scratches.

=== HUMAN INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how a human would complete the task of opening the door, with each instruction linked to an observation in the image:

1. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**
   - **Instruction: Approach the door and locate the brass doorknob.**

2. **Observation: The door is equipped with hinges on the top and bottom, allowing it to swing open and closed.**
   - **Instruction: Ensure that you are on the correct side of the door where the doorknob is accessible and the door can swing open towards you or away from you.**

3. **Observation: The door is set within a white trimmed frame.**
   - **Instruction: Position yourself in front of the door, within the white trimmed frame, to prepare for opening it.**

4. **Observation: The floor appears to be made of light-colored tiles.**
   - **Instruction: Stand firmly on the light-colored tiled floor to maintain balance while opening the door.**

5. **Observation: There is a small object, possibly a shoe, visible at the bottom left corner of the image.**
   - **Instruction: Be cautious of the small object (possibly a shoe) at the bottom left corner to avoid tripping over it as you reach for the doorknob.**

6. **Observation: The door's surface shows signs of wear and tear, with some scuff marks and scratches.**
   - **Instruction: Grasp the brass doorknob firmly, considering the wear and tear on the door's surface, which might make it slightly harder to turn if the mechanism is worn out.**

7. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**
   - **Instruction: Turn the brass doorknob clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the door's design) to disengage the latch mechanism.**

8. **Observation: The door is equipped with hinges on the top and bottom, allowing it to swing open and closed.**
   - **Instruction: Push or pull the door gently in the direction it swings (inward or outward) to open it fully.**

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully open the door.

   - **Robot Command: No specific command needed, just ensure the robot is positioned correctly.**

3. **Observation: The door is set within a white trimmed frame.**
   - **Instruction: Position yourself in front of the door, within the white trimmed frame, to prepare for opening it.**
   - **Robot Command: move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)** (Reaffirming the position)

4. **Observation: The floor appears to be made of light-colored tiles.**
   - **Instruction: Stand firmly on the light-colored tiled floor to maintain balance while opening the door.**
   - **Robot Command: No specific command needed, just ensure the robot is stable.**

5. **Observation: There is a small object, possibly a shoe, visible at the bottom left corner of the image.**
   - **Instruction: Be cautious of the small object (possibly a shoe) at the bottom left corner to avoid tripping over it as you reach for the doorknob.**
   - **Robot Command: move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)** (Ensure the path is clear)

6. **Observation: The door's surface shows signs of wear and tear, with some scuff marks and scratches.**
   - **Instruction: Grasp the brass doorknob firmly, considering the wear and tear on the door's surface, which might make it slightly harder to turn if the mechanism is worn out.**
   - **Robot Command: grab(door_knob)**

7. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**
   - **Instruction: Turn the brass doorknob clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the door's design) to disengage the latch mechanism.**
   - **Robot Command: rotate(angle)** (Rotate the doorknob to disengage the latch)

8. **Observation: The door is equipped with hinges on the top and bottom, allowing it to swing open and closed.**
   - **Instruction: Push or pull the door gently in the direction it swings (inward or outward) to open it fully.**
   - **Robot Command: pull(door)** or **push(door)** (Depending on the door's swing direction)

9. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**
   - **Instruction: Release the doorknob after opening the door.**
   - **Robot Command: release(door_knob)**

By following these commands, the robotic arm should be able to successfully open the door.

=== REFINED ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

   - **Robot Command: move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)** (Ensure the path is clear)

6. **Observation: The door's surface shows signs of wear and tear, with some scuff marks and scratches.**
   - **Instruction: Grasp the brass doorknob firmly, considering the wear and tear on the door's surface, which might make it slightly harder to turn if the mechanism is worn out.**
   - **Robot Command: grab(door_knob)**

7. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**
   - **Instruction: Turn the brass doorknob clockwise to disengage the latch mechanism.**
   - **Robot Command: rotate(90)** (Assuming a 90-degree turn is needed to disengage the latch)

8. **Observation: The door is equipped with hinges on the top and bottom, allowing it to swing open and closed.**
   - **Instruction: Pull the door gently towards you to open it fully.**
   - **Robot Command: pull(door)**

9. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a brass doorknob.**

# No specific command needed

# Reaffirm the position in front of the door
move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)

# Ensure the robot is stable on the tiled floor
# No specific command needed

# Ensure the path is clear of the small object
move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)

# Grasp the brass doorknob
grab(door_knob)

# Turn the doorknob clockwise to disengage the latch
rotate(90)

# Pull the door gently towards you to open it
pull(door)
