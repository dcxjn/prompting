=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

 Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the necessary information to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates of the door handle.)
2. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
4. How much force is needed to turn or push the door handle?
5. What is the angle needed to rotate the handle to open the door?
6. Is the door locked? (If yes, how do you unlock it?)
7. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
8. Is there anything blocking the door or the path to the door?
9. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it after turning the handle?
10. How wide does the door need to be opened for someone to pass through?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===


USER:
        You are a robotic arm positioned facing the image.
        Examine the given image and answer the following questions.
        Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the necessary information to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates of the door handle.)
2. What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
3. Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
4. How much force is needed to turn or push the door handle?
5. What is the angle needed to rotate the handle to open the door?
6. Is the door locked? (If yes, how do you unlock it?)
7. What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
8. Is there anything blocking the door or the path to the door?
9. Do I need to push or pull the door to open it after turning the handle?
10. How wide does the door need to be opened for someone to pass through?

These questions will help ensure that the robotic arm has all the necessary information to successfully open the door.

ASSISTANT: 1. The door is located at the end of the hallway, approximately at the center of the image, with the door handle on the right side, about two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the image.

2. The door handle is a lever-style handle.

3. The door opens away from the viewer, as indicated by the direction the door is open in the image.

4. The force needed to turn the lever handle is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a standard amount of force, as the door is open and unobstructed.

5. The angle needed to rotate the handle to open the door is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a standard angle for a lever-style handle.

6. The door is not locked in the image, so no unlocking action is needed.

7. The height of the door handle from the ground is not visible in the image, but it appears to be at a standard height for a door handle.

8. There is nothing blocking the door or the path to the door in the image.

9. Pulling the door open is the correct action, as indicated by the direction the door is open in the image.

10. The door needs to be fully open for someone to pass through, which is not visible in the image, but it appears to be a standard width for a door.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, along with reasons for each instruction:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Instruction:** `move_to(door_handle_x, door_handle_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to position itself at the door handle to interact with it. The exact coordinates (door_handle_x, door_handle_y) should be determined based on the image, approximately two-thirds up from the bottom and on the right side.

2. **grab(door_handle)**
   - **Instruction:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to secure the door handle to apply the necessary force to turn it.

3. **rotate(angle)**
   - **Instruction:** `rotate(standard_lever_angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to rotate the lever handle to open the door. The standard angle for a lever handle is typically around 30-45 degrees.

4. **release(door_handle)**
   - **Instruction:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** After rotating the handle, the robotic arm should release it to proceed with opening the door.

5. **move_to(door_edge_x, door_edge_y)**
   - **Instruction:** `move_to(door_edge_x, door_edge_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to position itself at the edge of the door to pull it open. The exact coordinates (door_edge_x, door_edge_y) should be determined based on the image, near the edge of the door.

6. **pull(door)**
   - **Instruction:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** The door opens away from the viewer, so the robotic arm needs to pull the door towards itself to open it.

7. **move_to(door_open_x, door_open_y)**
   - **Instruction:** `move_to(door_open_x, door_open_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to move to a position where it can fully open the door. The exact coordinates (door_open_x, door_open_y) should be determined based on the image, ensuring the door is fully open.

8. **pull(door)**
   - **Instruction:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to continue pulling the door until it is fully open, allowing someone to pass through.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure the arm interacts correctly with the door handle and the door itself, taking into account the direction the door opens and the type of handle used.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

 ```python
# Move to the door handle position
move_to(door_handle_x, door_handle_y)

# Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Rotate the handle to open the door
rotate(standard_lever_angle)

# Release the door handle
release(door_handle)

# Move to the edge of the door
move_to(door_edge_x, door_edge_y)

# Pull the door to start opening it
pull(door)

# Move to a position to fully open the door
move_to(door_open_x, door_open_y)

# Continue pulling the door until fully open
pull(door)
```
