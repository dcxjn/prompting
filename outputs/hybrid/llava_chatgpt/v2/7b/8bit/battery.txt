=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to get the battery using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the battery located? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the battery on a flat surface or inside something?
3. What does the battery look like? (Please describe its size, shape, and color.)
4. Is there anything blocking the way to the battery?
5. Can the battery be grabbed directly, or does it need to be pushed or pulled first?
6. Is the battery fragile or safe to handle with the robotic arm?
7. Are there any other objects near the battery that need to be moved first?
8. What is the best angle to approach the battery for grabbing it?
9. Is there a specific place where the battery needs to be placed after grabbing it? (Please give the exact x and y coordinates.)
10. Are there any special instructions for handling the battery, like avoiding certain movements or angles?

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to complete the task of getting the battery using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. The battery is located at the bottom right corner of the image, with the x coordinate being approximately 0.75 and the y coordinate being approximately 0.55.
2. The battery is sitting on a flat surface.
3. The battery is small, rectangular, and has a green and black color scheme.
4. There are no objects blocking the way to the battery.
5. The battery can be grabbed directly.
6. The battery appears to be fragile and should be handled with care.
7. There are no other objects near the battery that need to be moved first.
8. The best angle to approach the battery for grabbing it would be from the side, as it is sitting on a flat surface.
9. There is no specific place where the battery needs to be placed after grabbing it. The image does not provide enough information to determine the desired location.
10. There are no special instructions for handling the battery, such as avoiding certain movements or angles.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided information and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to get the battery:

1. **move_to(0.75, 0.55)**
   - **Reason:** This command moves the robotic arm to the exact location of the battery, which is at the bottom right corner of the image with coordinates (0.75, 0.55).

2. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotating the arm by 90 degrees positions it to approach the battery from the side, which is the best angle for grabbing it as it is sitting on a flat surface.

3. **grab(battery)**
   - **Reason:** This command instructs the robotic arm to grab the battery directly, as it can be grabbed without any obstructions.

4. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Since there is no specific place where the battery needs to be placed after grabbing it, moving the arm to the center of the image (coordinates 0.5, 0.5) ensures the battery is in a neutral and easily accessible position for any further instructions.

5. **release(battery)**
   - **Reason:** This command releases the battery at the new location, completing the task of getting the battery.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully grab the battery and move it to a central location, ensuring it is handled with care and without any unnecessary movements.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(0.75, 0.55)  # Move to battery location
rotate(90)           # Rotate to approach battery
grab(battery)        # Grab the battery
move_to(0.5, 0.5)    # Move to center of the image
release(battery)     # Release the battery
```
