=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some questions that will help gather the necessary information to get the teapot using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the teapot right now? (What are the x and y coordinates of the teapot?)
2. Is the teapot on a table or on the floor?
3. Is there anything in the way of the teapot that the robotic arm needs to move?
4. What does the teapot look like? (Is it big, small, heavy, or light?)
5. Can the robotic arm reach the teapot from its current position?
6. Is the teapot safe to grab, or is it hot or fragile?
7. Do I need to rotate the teapot to grab it properly?
8. Where should I put the teapot after grabbing it? (What are the x and y coordinates of the destination?)
9. Is there a specific way to grab the teapot to avoid spilling anything inside it?
10. Should I push or pull the teapot before grabbing it to make it easier to reach?

These questions will help ensure that all necessary details are covered to successfully complete the task of getting the teapot using the robotic arm.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Given that the teapot is not visible in the image provided and the robotic arm is in the position of the 'viewer', we need to take a systematic approach to locate the teapot and then retrieve it. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would complete the task:

1. **Rotate(45 degrees)**
   - **Reason:** Start by rotating the robotic arm to the right to scan the area. This will help in locating the teapot if it is outside the initial field of view.

2. **Move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to a new position to get a different perspective. This will help in scanning a larger area. (Note: x and y should be chosen based on the layout of the environment.)

3. **Rotate(-90 degrees)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robotic arm to the left to continue scanning the area. This ensures that the arm covers a wide field of view.

4. **Move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to another position to further scan the area. This step is to ensure that no area is left unchecked.

5. **Repeat Steps 1-4**
   - **Reason:** Continue scanning the area by rotating and moving the robotic arm until the teapot is located. Adjust the angles and positions as needed to cover the entire area.

6. **Once the teapot is located:**
   - **Move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y)**
     - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the coordinates where the teapot is located.

7. **Grab(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** Use the grab command to securely hold the teapot.

8. **Move_to(destination_x, destination_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robotic arm to the coordinates where the teapot needs to be placed.

9. **Release(teapot)**
   - **Reason:** Release the teapot at the desired location.

### Additional Considerations:
- **If the teapot is on a higher or lower surface:**
  - **Move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y, z)**
    - **Reason:** Adjust the z-coordinate to match the height of the teapot.

- **If the teapot is obstructed:**
  - **Push(obstruction) or Pull(obstruction)**
    - **Reason:** Clear any obstruction before grabbing the teapot.

### Summary:
The key steps involve systematically scanning the area by rotating and moving the robotic arm, locating the teapot, moving to its position, grabbing it, and then placing it at the desired location. Each instruction is aimed at ensuring that the robotic arm covers the entire area and successfully retrieves the teapot.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Step 1: Rotate 45 degrees to the right
rotate(45)

# Step 2: Move to a new position (x1, y1)
move_to(x1, y1)

# Step 3: Rotate -90 degrees to the left
rotate(-90)

# Step 4: Move to another position (x2, y2)
move_to(x2, y2)

# Step 5: Repeat Steps 1-4 until teapot is located
while not teapot_located:
    rotate(45)
    move_to(next_x, next_y)
    rotate(-90)
    move_to(next_x, next_y)

# Step 6: Move to the teapot's location
move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y)

# Step 7: Grab the teapot
grab(teapot)

# Step 8: Move to the destination
move_to(destination_x, destination_y)

# Step 9: Release the teapot
release(teapot)

# Additional Considerations
# If the teapot is on a higher or lower surface
move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y, teapot_z)

# If the teapot is obstructed
if obstruction_detected:
    push(obstruction) or pull(obstruction)
```
