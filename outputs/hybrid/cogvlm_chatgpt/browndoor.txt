=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

- The door is a wooden six-panel door with a smooth finish.
- The door is equipped with a round, metallic doorknob on the right side.
- The door is set within a white trimmed frame.
- The door is closed.
- There is a small gap at the bottom of the door, which may indicate it is not perfectly aligned with the floor.
- The floor appears to be made of tiles.
- There is a small object or debris on the floor near the base of the door, which could be a potential hazard or simply a minor detail.

Observations:
- The door is closed, so it is not possible to open it from the image provided.
- The presence of the doorknob suggests that the door can be opened from the inside.
- The door's alignment with the floor may require adjustment to ensure it opens and closes smoothly.
- The small object on the floor could be a potential hazard if someone were to trip over it, so it would be advisable to clean or remove it.

=== HUMAN INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how a human would complete the task of opening the door, with each instruction linked to the relevant observation:

1. **Observation: The door is closed, so it is not possible to open it from the image provided.**
   - **Instruction:** Approach the door to physically interact with it.

2. **Observation: The door is equipped with a round, metallic doorknob on the right side.**
   - **Instruction:** Reach out and grasp the round, metallic doorknob with your hand.

3. **Observation: The door is closed.**
   - **Instruction:** Turn the doorknob clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the door's mechanism) to disengage the latch.

4. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a smooth finish.**
   - **Instruction:** While holding the doorknob, gently pull or push the door to begin opening it.

5. **Observation: The door is set within a white trimmed frame.**
   - **Instruction:** Ensure that the door moves smoothly within the white trimmed frame as you continue to open it.

6. **Observation: The door's alignment with the floor may require adjustment to ensure it opens and closes smoothly.**
   - **Instruction:** If you encounter resistance, slightly lift the door by the doorknob to help it clear any misalignment with the floor.

7. **Observation: The floor appears to be made of tiles.**
   - **Instruction:** Be cautious of your footing on the tiled floor to avoid slipping as you open the door.

8. **Observation: There is a small object or debris on the floor near the base of the door, which could be a potential hazard or simply a minor detail.**
   - **Instruction:** Before fully opening the door, check for and remove any small objects or debris near the base to prevent tripping.

By following these instructions, you should be able to open the door safely and effectively.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Here is a step-by-step guide on how the robotic arm would complete the task of opening the door, using the provided commands:

1. **Observation: The door is closed, so it is not possible to open it from the image provided.**
   - **Instruction:** Approach the door to physically interact with it.
   - **Robot Command:** `move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob)` (Move the robotic arm to the position of the doorknob.)

2. **Observation: The door is equipped with a round, metallic doorknob on the right side.**
   - **Instruction:** Reach out and grasp the round, metallic doorknob with your hand.
   - **Robot Command:** `grab(doorknob)` (Command the robotic arm to grab the doorknob.)

3. **Observation: The door is closed.**
   - **Instruction:** Turn the doorknob clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the door's mechanism) to disengage the latch.
   - **Robot Command:** `rotate(angle)` (Rotate the doorknob to disengage the latch. The angle will depend on the specific door mechanism, typically around 90 degrees.)

4. **Observation: The door is a wooden six-panel door with a smooth finish.**
   - **Instruction:** While holding the doorknob, gently pull or push the door to begin opening it.
   - **Robot Command:** `pull(doorknob)` (Pull the doorknob to start opening the door.)

5. **Observation: The door is set within a white trimmed frame.**
   - **Instruction:** Ensure that the door moves smoothly within the white trimmed frame as you continue to open it.
   - **Robot Command:** Continue `pull(doorknob)` (Continue pulling the doorknob to open the door further.)

6. **Observation: The door's alignment with the floor may require adjustment to ensure it opens and closes smoothly.**
   - **Instruction:** If you encounter resistance, slightly lift the door by the doorknob to help it clear any misalignment with the floor.
   - **Robot Command:** If resistance is detected, `move_to(x_door_knob, y_door_knob + adjustment)` (Adjust the position of the robotic arm slightly upwards to lift the door.)

7. **Observation: The floor appears to be made of tiles.**
   - **Instruction:** Be cautious of your footing on the tiled floor to avoid slipping as you open the door.
   - **Robot Command:** Ensure stable movement commands to avoid slipping.

8. **Observation: There is a small object or debris on the floor near the base of the door, which could be a potential hazard or simply a minor detail.**
   - **Instruction:** Before fully opening the door, check for and remove any small objects or debris near the base to prevent tripping.
   - **Robot Command:** `move_to(x_object, y_object)` (Move the robotic arm to the position of the small object or debris.)
   - **Robot Command:** `grab(object)` (Grab the small object or debris.)
   - **Robot Command:** `move_to(x_safe_location, y_safe_location)` (Move the object to a safe location.)
   - **Robot Command:** `release(object)` (Release the object in the safe location.)

By following these commands, the robotic arm should be able to open the door safely and effectively.
