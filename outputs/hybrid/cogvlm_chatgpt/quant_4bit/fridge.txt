=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

 - Refrigerator: The refrigerator is a stainless steel appliance with a digital display and a pull-out drawer. It is located in a kitchen setting with wooden cabinets and beige walls.
- Pull-out drawer: This drawer is situated below the refrigerator's main door and is likely designed for convenience in accessing items stored at the bottom of the fridge.
- Wooden cabinets: These cabinets are positioned on either side of the refrigerator, providing storage space for kitchen items.
- Beige walls: The walls in the background have a light beige color, which complements the wooden cabinets and the stainless steel refrigerator.
- Towel: There is a towel hanging on the left side of the refrigerator, suggesting it might be used for drying hands after washing dishes or for holding hot items.
- Digital display: This display is located on the refrigerator's main door, possibly indicating the temperature or other settings.

Observations:
- The refrigerator is the primary appliance for storing food items, which would include apples.
- The pull-out drawer could potentially hold items like apples, making them easily accessible.
- The towel suggests that the kitchen is frequently used, which means there might be a need for drying hands.
- The digital display on the refrigerator could be used to adjust the temperature, ensuring that stored items, including apples, are kept at the desired condition.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Certainly! Here is a detailed guide on how the robot would complete the task of getting an apple using the provided commands:

1. **Observation: The refrigerator is the primary appliance for storing food items, which would include apples.**
   - **Instruction:** Move the robotic arm towards the refrigerator.
   - **Command:** `move_to(refrigerator_x, refrigerator_y)`

2. **Observation: The refrigerator is a stainless steel appliance with a digital display and a pull-out drawer.**
   - **Instruction:** Locate the stainless steel refrigerator with the digital display.
   - **Command:** (This is more of a visual confirmation step, so no specific command is needed here.)

3. **Observation: The pull-out drawer could potentially hold items like apples, making them easily accessible.**
   - **Instruction:** Reach for the pull-out drawer situated below the refrigerator's main door.
   - **Command:** `move_to(drawer_handle_x, drawer_handle_y)`

4. **Observation: This drawer is situated below the refrigerator's main door and is likely designed for convenience in accessing items stored at the bottom of the fridge.**
   - **Instruction:** Pull out the drawer gently to access the items stored inside.
   - **Command:** `pull(drawer_handle)`

5. **Observation: The refrigerator is the primary appliance for storing food items, which would include apples.**
   - **Instruction:** Look inside the pull-out drawer for apples.
   - **Command:** (This is more of a visual confirmation step, so no specific command is needed here.)

6. **Observation: The towel suggests that the kitchen is frequently used, which means there might be a need for drying hands.**
   - **Instruction:** If your hands are wet or dirty, use the towel hanging on the left side of the refrigerator to dry or clean them.
   - **Command:** (This step is not applicable to the robotic arm as it does not need to dry or clean its "hands.")

7. **Observation: The pull-out drawer could potentially hold items like apples, making them easily accessible.**
   - **Instruction:** Once you locate the apples inside the pull-out drawer, take one out.
   - **Command:**
     - `move_to(apple_x, apple_y)`
     - `grab(apple)`

8. **Observation: The digital display on the refrigerator could be used to adjust the temperature, ensuring that stored items, including apples, are kept at the desired condition.**
   - **Instruction:** If necessary, check the digital display to ensure the refrigerator is set to the appropriate temperature for storing apples.
   - **Command:** (This step is more of a monitoring task and may not be directly applicable to the robotic arm's current task of getting an apple.)

9. **Final Step:**
   - **Instruction:** Move the apple to the desired location.
   - **Command:**
     - `move_to(destination_x, destination_y)`
     - `release(apple)`

By following these commands, the robotic arm should be able to successfully get an apple from the refrigerator and place it at the desired location.
