=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

 - The door is a double door with a metallic finish.
- It has a handle on the right side.
- There are two glass panels on the door.
- Above the door, there is a sign indicating "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY".
- To the right of the door, there is a yellow safety barrier.
- Below the door, there is a yellow floor marking.
- On the wall to the right of the door, there are multiple signs and symbols, including a biohazard symbol.
- The door appears to be locked, as there is no visible keyhole or mechanism to open it from the outside.

Observations:
- The door's handle is on the right side, which may require the person to open it from the inside.
- The presence of the yellow safety barrier suggests that the area beyond the door is restricted or potentially hazardous.
- The yellow floor marking could indicate a specific path or area to be aware of.
- The biohazard symbol on the wall indicates that the area beyond the door may contain materials or substances that are harmful if ingested, inhaled, or come into contact with. Therefore, these features are relevant to the task of opening the door, but the person would need authorization and potentially a key to do so.

=== HUMAN INSTRUCTIONS ===

 Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how a human would complete the task of opening the door, with each instruction linked to the relevant observation:

1. **Observation: The door is a double door with a metallic finish.**
   - **Instruction:** Approach the double door with a metallic finish.

2. **Observation: The door's handle is on the right side, which may require the person to open it from the inside.**
   - **Instruction:** Note that the handle is on the right side of the door, which suggests that it may need to be opened from the inside or with a specific mechanism.

3. **Observation: Above the door, there is a sign indicating "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY".**
   - **Instruction:** Ensure that you have the necessary authorization to access this area, as indicated by the "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY" sign above the door.

4. **Observation: The door appears to be locked, as there is no visible keyhole or mechanism to open it from the outside.**
   - **Instruction:** Since there is no visible keyhole or mechanism to open the door from the outside, you will need to find an alternative method to unlock it, such as using an access card or contacting authorized personnel.

5. **Observation: To the right of the door, there is a yellow safety barrier.**
   - **Instruction:** Be cautious of the yellow safety barrier to the right of the door, which indicates that the area may be restricted or hazardous.

6. **Observation: Below the door, there is a yellow floor marking.**
   - **Instruction:** Stay within the yellow floor marking below the door, which may indicate a safe path or area to stand while attempting to open the door.

7. **Observation: On the wall to the right of the door, there are multiple signs and symbols, including a biohazard symbol.**
   - **Instruction:** Be aware of the biohazard symbol and other signs on the wall to the right of the door, which indicate that the area beyond the door may contain hazardous materials. Take necessary precautions, such as wearing protective gear if required.

8. **Observation: The presence of the yellow safety barrier suggests that the area beyond the door is restricted or potentially hazardous.**
   - **Instruction:** Proceed with caution and ensure you have the proper authorization and safety measures in place before attempting to open the door.

By following these instructions linked to the observations, a human would be able to approach the task of opening the door in a safe and authorized manner.

6. **Observation: Below the door, there is a yellow floor marking.**
   - **Instruction:** Stay within the yellow floor marking below the door.
   - **Command:** `move_to(floor_marking_x, floor_marking_y)`

7. **Observation: On the wall to the right of the door, there are multiple signs and symbols, including a biohazard symbol.**
   - **Instruction:** Be aware of the biohazard symbol and other signs on the wall to the right of the door. Ensure the robotic arm takes necessary precautions.
   - **Command:** This is more of a human verification step and does not require a robotic command.

8. **Observation: The presence of the yellow safety barrier suggests that the area beyond the door is restricted or potentially hazardous.**
