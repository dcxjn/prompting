=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

Based on the image provided, the door appears to be locked. There is a visible doorknob and a doorknobhole, but no handle or keyhole is visible, which suggests that the door is likely locked from the inside.
No, I do not have a key to the door.
The key is not visible in the image.
To unlock the door, you would insert the key into the keyhole located at the top center of the door. Then, turn the key clockwise until it clicks into place, unlocking the door.
Yes, the doorknob or handle on the door appears to be a ring-style handle, which typically requires a circular motion to turn. It's common for such handles to be turned clockwise or counterclockwise to open the door.
No, you do not need to move the potted plants to open the door.
Based on the image provided, there does not appear to be anything behind the door that would block it from opening. The door seems to be set in a wall with clear space on both sides, and there are no visible obstructions or objects that could interfere with its opening mechanism.
No, the black knocker is a decorative element and does not serve a functional purpose in opening the door.
Based on the image provided, there is no visible indication of a specific time when the door is allowed to be opened.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself in front of the door to interact with it. The coordinates `(door_x, door_y)` should be the location of the door.

2. **Move Arm to Keyhole:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(keyhole_x, keyhole_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned at the keyhole to insert the key. The coordinates `(keyhole_x, keyhole_y)` should be the location of the keyhole at the top center of the door.

3. **Insert Key (Simulated):**
   - **Command:** `grab(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to simulate grabbing the key to insert it into the keyhole. Since the key is not visible, this step assumes the robot has a key ready to use.

4. **Turn Key to Unlock:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(90)` (or appropriate angle)
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to turn the key clockwise to unlock the door. The angle should be sufficient to simulate the key turning until it clicks into place.

5. **Move Arm to Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(doorknob_x, doorknob_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned at the door knob to turn it. The coordinates `(doorknob_x, doorknob_y)` should be the location of the door knob.

6. **Grab Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `grab(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to grab the door knob to turn it.

7. **Turn Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(45)` (or appropriate angle)
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to turn the door knob to open the door. The angle should be sufficient to simulate the knob turning to open the door.

8. **Pull Door Open:**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to pull the door towards itself to open it. This action will open the door if it swings outward.

9. **Release Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `release(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to release the door knob after the door is opened.

### Summary of Commands
1. `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
2. `arm_move_to(keyhole_x, keyhole_y)`
3. `grab(key)`
4. `arm_rotate(90)`
5. `arm_move_to(doorknob_x, doorknob_y)`
6. `grab(doorknob)`
7. `arm_rotate(45)`
8. `pull(door)`
9. `release(doorknob)`

### Notes
- The exact coordinates `(door_x, door_y)`, `(keyhole_x, keyhole_y)`, and `(doorknob_x, doorknob_y)` need to be determined based on the robot's initial position and the door's location.
- The angles for `arm_rotate` are approximations and may need adjustment based on the actual mechanism of the door knob and keyhole.
- The robot's actions assume that the door opens outward and that the key is available for use.
