=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases a blue front door of a house. The door is painted in a solid blue color and has a black knocker in the center. To the left of the door, there's a white wall with the house number '48' written in black numerals. On the right side of the door, there's a mailbox. In front of the door, there are two potted fern plants, one on each side. Additionally, there's a striped doormat on the floor and a vintage-looking container with the label 'Krispy Kreme' on the right.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- Where is the key to the door if it is locked?
- How do you use the key to unlock the door?
- Do you need to turn the doorknob or push the door to open it?
- Is there anything in front of the door that needs to be moved first?
- Do you need to be careful of the potted plants when opening the door?
- Is there a special way to use the black knocker on the door?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door appears to be locked. There is no visible keyhole or handle that would indicate it is unlocked.
The key to the door is not visible in the image.
To unlock the door, you would insert the key into the keyhole located at the top center of the door. Then, turn the key clockwise until it clicks into place, unlocking the door.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a push door as there is no visible doorknob on the visible side.
Yes, there is a doormat in front of the door that would need to be moved first.
No, you do not need to be careful of the potted plants when opening the door. They are positioned away from the door's path and are securely placed.
The black knocker on the door appears to be a traditional horse head design, which is often used for decorative purposes. While it doesn't typically have a functional role in opening the door, it can be used to knock or signal someone inside. However, if it were to be used as a handle, one would need to ensure it is securely attached and can bear the weight without detaching.

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door Area**
   - **Command:** `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself in front of the door to interact with it.

2. **Move Arm to Doormat**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(doormat_x, doormat_y)`
   - **Reason:** The doormat needs to be moved out of the way to ensure the door can be opened without obstruction.

3. **Grab Doormat**
   - **Command:** `grab(doormat)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to secure the doormat to move it.

4. **Move Doormat to the Side**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(side_x, side_y)`
   - **Reason:** Relocate the doormat to a position where it won't obstruct the door.

5. **Release Doormat**
   - **Command:** `release(doormat)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to let go of the doormat after moving it.

6. **Move Arm to Keyhole**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(keyhole_x, keyhole_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position its arm at the keyhole to insert the key.

7. **Insert Key into Keyhole**
   - **Command:** `grab(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to grab the key to insert it into the keyhole.

8. **Turn Key Clockwise**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(clockwise_angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to turn the key to unlock the door.

9. **Release Key**
   - **Command:** `release(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to let go of the key after unlocking the door.

10. **Move Arm to Door Center**
    - **Command:** `arm_move_to(door_center_x, door_center_y)`
    - **Reason:** The robot needs to position its arm at the center of the door to push it open.

11. **Push Door**
    - **Command:** `push(door)`
    - **Reason:** The robot needs to apply force to the door to open it.

### Coordinates and Angles
- `door_x, door_y`: Coordinates of the door area.
- `doormat_x, doormat_y`: Coordinates of the doormat.
- `side_x, side_y`: Coordinates to the side where the doormat will be moved.
- `keyhole_x, keyhole_y`: Coordinates of the keyhole.
- `door_center_x, door_center_y`: Coordinates of the center of the door.
- `clockwise_angle`: Angle required to turn the key clockwise.

### Assumptions
- The robot has a predefined map of the environment with coordinates for the door, doormat, keyhole, and other relevant objects.
- The robot can identify and differentiate objects like the doormat, key, and door.

By following these steps, the robot will be able to open the door efficiently and effectively.
