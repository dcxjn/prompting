=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases a wooden door with six panels. The door is set in a white frame and has a golden doorknob. The floor appears to be made of tiles, and there's a small portion of a black object, possibly a piece of furniture, visible at the bottom right corner.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- If the door is locked, where is the key?
- How do you turn the golden doorknob to open the door?
- Do you need to push or pull the door to open it?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?
- Is the black object near the door in the way?
- Is the floor slippery or safe to walk on?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door appears to be locked. There is no visible keyhole or handle in the image that would indicate it is unlocked.
The key is not visible in the image.
To turn the golden doorknob and open the door, you would typically use your hand to grip the knob and rotate it clockwise or counterclockwise. The direction of rotation would depend on the door's hinge mechanism and whether it opens inward or outward.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a standard swing door with a handle on the right side. Typically, to open such a door, you would push it away from you. However, if the handle is on the inside and you are outside, you would need to pull the door towards you.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door from opening. The door appears to be in good condition and is fully closed.
No, the black object near the door is not in the way. It is positioned to the right of the door, outside the frame of the image, and does not appear to be obstructing the door's path or operation.
The floor appears to be safe to walk on. There are no visible signs of water, oils, or other substances that could make it slippery. The floor looks clean and dry.

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself in front of the door to interact with it. The coordinates `(door_x, door_y)` should be the location directly in front of the door.

2. **Move Arm to Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(knob_x, knob_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot's arm needs to be positioned at the doorknob to grab and turn it. The coordinates `(knob_x, knob_y)` should be the location of the golden doorknob.

3. **Grab the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `grab(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to secure the doorknob to turn it. This command ensures the robot's grip on the doorknob.

4. **Rotate the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to turn the doorknob to unlock the door. The angle should be determined based on the door's hinge mechanism. For example, if the door opens inward and the knob needs to be turned clockwise, the angle should be set accordingly.

5. **Pull the Door:**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door handle is on the right side and the door typically opens inward, the robot needs to pull the door towards itself to open it.

6. **Release the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `release(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** After the door is opened, the robot can release the doorknob.

7. **Move Back to Avoid Obstruction:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(initial_x, initial_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot should move back to its initial position to avoid obstructing the door's path and to ensure it is not in the way of the door's movement.

### Example Commands with Hypothetical Coordinates
Assuming the door is at coordinates (5, 5) and the doorknob is at (5, 4):

1. `move_to(5, 5)`
2. `arm_move_to(5, 4)`
3. `grab(doorknob)`
4. `arm_rotate(45)`  // Assuming 45 degrees is the required angle to turn the knob
5. `pull(door)`
6. `release(doorknob)`
7. `move_to(3, 5)`  // Moving back to initial position

By following these steps, the robot should be able to successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door
move_to(5, 5)

# Move arm to doorknob
arm_move_to(5, 4)

# Grab the doorknob
grab(doorknob)

# Rotate the doorknob
arm_rotate(45)

# Pull the door
pull(door)

# Release the doorknob
release(doorknob)

# Move back to avoid obstruction
move_to(3, 5)
```
