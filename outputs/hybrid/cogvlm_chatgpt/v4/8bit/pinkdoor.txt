=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases an interior setting, predominantly featuring a pink door with a white frame. To the left of the door, there's a light blue wall with a small cross hanging from it. Below the cross, there's a light switch. Adjacent to the door, on the right, is a tall wooden plank leaning against the wall. At the base of the door, there's a vent or grille on the floor.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- Where is the door handle or knob?
- Do you need to turn the handle or knob to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?
- Do you need to move the tall wooden plank to open the door?
- Is the vent or grille on the floor in front of the door?
- Do you need to step over the vent or grille to open the door?
- Is there a light switch you need to use before opening the door?
- Is the cross on the wall in the way of opening the door?
- Do you need to push or pull the door to open it?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door appears to be locked. There is a visible doorknob on the door, but there is no visible keyhole or any indication that the door is currently unlocked.
The door handle or knob is located on the right side of the door, near the bottom.
Based on the image, the door appears to have a push mechanism as there is no visible handle or knob on the visible side.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door from opening. It appears to be a standard door with a handle and hinge mechanism.
No, the tall wooden plank is leaning against the wall and does not appear to be obstructing the door's opening.
Yes, the vent or grille is on the floor in front of the door.
No, you do not need to step over the vent or grille to open the door. The grille is located at the bottom of the door, and the vent is on the wall to the left of the door.
No, there is no light switch visible in the image that needs to be used before opening the door.
No, the cross on the wall is not in the way of opening the door. It is positioned to the left of the door, outside the door's opening.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a standard hinged door. Typically, to open such a door, you would push it. However, without seeing the entire door's mechanism or the orientation of the hinges, this is a general assumption.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself in front of the door to interact with it. The coordinates `(door_x, door_y)` should be the location of the door.

2. **Move Arm to Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(knob_x, knob_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned at the door knob to interact with it. The coordinates `(knob_x, knob_y)` should be the location of the door knob.

3. **Grab the Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `grab(knob)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to grab the door knob to turn it and unlock the door.

4. **Rotate the Arm to Turn the Knob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to rotate the knob to unlock the door. The `angle` should be the appropriate angle to turn the knob and unlock the door.

5. **Release the Door Knob:**
   - **Command:** `release(knob)`
   - **Reason:** After turning the knob, the robot needs to release it to proceed with opening the door.

6. **Move Arm to Door Surface:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(door_surface_x, door_surface_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned on the door surface to push it open. The coordinates `(door_surface_x, door_surface_y)` should be a point on the door surface.

7. **Push the Door:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to push the door to open it. Since the door has a push mechanism, this action will open the door.

### Coordinates and Angles
- **door_x, door_y:** Coordinates of the door.
- **knob_x, knob_y:** Coordinates of the door knob.
- **door_surface_x, door_surface_y:** Coordinates on the door surface.
- **angle:** The angle required to turn the door knob.

### Example with Hypothetical Coordinates
Assuming the following coordinates:
- Door: `(100, 50)`
- Knob: `(105, 55)`
- Door Surface: `(110, 50)`
- Angle to turn knob: `90 degrees`

The commands would be:
1. `move_to(100, 50)`
2. `arm_move_to(105, 55)`
3. `grab(knob)`
4. `arm_rotate(90)`
5. `release(knob)`
6. `arm_move_to(110, 50)`
7. `push(door)`

### Reasoning Recap
- **Positioning:** The robot needs to be in the correct position to interact with the door.
- **Interaction:** The robot needs to grab and turn the knob to unlock the door.
- **Opening:** The robot needs to push the door to open it.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door
move_to(100, 50)  # Position robot in front of the door

# Grab the door knob
grab(knob)  # Grab the door knob

# Rotate the arm to turn the knob
arm_rotate(90)  # Turn the knob to unlock the door

# Release the door knob
release(knob)  # Release the door knob

# Move arm to door surface
arm_move_to(110, 50)  # Position arm on the door surface

# Push the door
push(door)  # Push the door to open it
```
