=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases an interior space, possibly a room or hallway. The room has a modern design with a large glass door or partition that separates it from another area. The door has a black frame. On the left side of the image, there's a white wall, while on the right, there's a wooden panel. Through the glass, one can see a reflection of a person sitting on the floor. There are also some objects on the floor, including what appears to be a pair of shoes.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- How do you open the door? Is there a handle or a button?
- Is the person sitting on the floor near the door?
- Are the shoes or any other objects blocking the door?
- Do you need to push or pull the door to open it?
- Is the door heavy or light to move?
- Is there enough space to open the door fully without hitting anything?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door appears to be locked. There is no visible handle or keyhole on the door's surface, and the door's frame is solid without any visible hinge or latch mechanism.
The door appears to be a modern glass door with a black frame. There is no visible handle or button on the door itself. However, there is a black handle on the right side of the door, which is likely used to open it.
Yes, the person is sitting on the floor near the door.
No, the shoes and other objects are not blocking the door. They are placed on the floor outside the door, indicating that the door is open and not obstructed by any items.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a push door. There is no visible handle or pull mechanism on the visible side of the door.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a modern glass door with a sleek frame. Typically, glass doors are lighter than solid wooden or metal doors. Therefore, it is likely that the door would be easier to move compared to heavier doors.
Yes, there appears to be enough space to open the door fully without hitting anything. The door is currently in a closed position, and the visible space on the floor to the left of the door seems clear of any obstructions.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)` where `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the door handle.
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself close to the door handle to interact with it.

2. **Position the Arm to the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(x, y)` where `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the door handle.
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be aligned with the door handle to push it.

3. **Push the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `push(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door is a push door, the robot needs to push the handle to open it.

4. **Move the Arm Back to Neutral Position**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(neutral_x, neutral_y)` where `(neutral_x, neutral_y)` are the coordinates of a neutral position for the arm.
   - **Reason:** After pushing the door, the arm should return to a neutral position to avoid any obstruction.

5. **Move the Robot Back to Allow Door to Open Fully**
   - **Command:** `move_to(new_x, new_y)` where `(new_x, new_y)` are coordinates that provide enough space for the door to open fully.
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to move back to ensure the door can open without hitting the robot.

### Detailed Reasoning for Each Step

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - The robot starts by moving its body to the coordinates of the door handle. This is essential because the robot needs to be close enough to interact with the handle effectively.

2. **Position the Arm to the Door Handle:**
   - The robot then moves its arm to the coordinates of the door handle. This step ensures that the arm is in the correct position to push the handle.

3. **Push the Door Handle:**
   - The robot uses the push command to push the door handle. Since the door is a push door, this action will open the door.

4. **Move the Arm Back to Neutral Position:**
   - After pushing the door, the robot moves its arm back to a neutral position. This step is important to avoid any potential obstruction or collision with the door as it opens.

5. **Move the Robot Back to Allow Door to Open Fully:**
   - Finally, the robot moves its body back to a new position that provides enough space for the door to open fully. This ensures that the door can swing open without hitting the robot, allowing for a clear passage.

By following these steps, the robot can successfully open the door while ensuring that it does not obstruct the door's movement or collide with any objects in the environment.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle
move_to(5, 10)

# Position the arm to the door handle
arm_move_to(5, 10)

# Push the door handle
push(door_handle)

# Move the arm back to neutral position
arm_move_to(0, 0)

# Move the robot back to allow door to open fully
move_to(2, 10)
```
