The image showcases an interior view of a building, possibly a medical facility or clinic. The foreground features a pair of automatic sliding doors with a sign indicating 'Emergency Check-In'. To the left of the doors, there's a wheelchair and a sign detailing the emergency check-in process. The reception area is visible through the doors, with a desk and a person behind it. The room has a modern design with a combination of wood and stone textures, and there are informational posters on the walls.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the button or sensor to open the automatic sliding doors?
- Do I need to press a button or just walk up to the doors for them to open?
- Is there a sign or symbol that shows how to open the doors?
- Are the doors already unlocked, or do I need a key or code to open them?
- Is there anyone nearby who can help me open the doors if I need assistance?
- Are there any instructions on the sign next to the doors about how to open them?
- Is the wheelchair blocking the doors, and do I need to move it first?
- Are the doors working properly, or is there a sign saying they are broken?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The button or sensor to open the automatic sliding doors is located on the top right corner of the door frame.
You do not need to press a button. The doors are equipped with an automatic sliding mechanism, so you can simply walk up to them and they will open.
No, there is no visible sign or symbol that shows how to open the doors.
The doors appear to be unlocked. There is no visible keyhole or keypad on the door, and the door is wide open, indicating that it is accessible without a key or code.
Yes, there is a sign on the wall that says, 'If you need assistance opening the doors, please ask a staff member.' So, if you need help, you should approach a staff member for assistance.
No, there are no instructions on the sign next to the doors about how to open them.
No, the wheelchair is not blocking the doors. The doors are open wide enough to allow someone to pass through without having to move the wheelchair.
The doors appear to be working properly. There is no visible sign indicating that they are broken.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **move_to(door_x, door_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot body to the coordinates directly in front of the automatic sliding doors. This is necessary because the doors are equipped with an automatic sliding mechanism that activates when someone approaches.

2. **arm_move_to(sensor_x, sensor_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot arm to the coordinates of the sensor located on the top right corner of the door frame. This step ensures that the robot arm is in the correct position to interact with the sensor if needed.

3. **arm_rotate(angle)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robot arm to face the sensor directly. This step ensures that the sensor can detect the presence of the robot arm, which might be necessary to trigger the automatic sliding mechanism.

4. **move_to(door_x - 1, door_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot body one step closer to the door. This step ensures that the robot is within the range of the sensor, which will trigger the automatic sliding doors to open.

5. **wait(2 seconds)**
   - **Reason:** Allow time for the automatic sliding doors to open fully. This step ensures that the doors have enough time to respond to the robot's presence and open wide enough for passage.

6. **move_to(reception_x, reception_y)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot body through the now-open doors and towards the reception area. This step completes the task of opening the door and allows the robot to proceed to the next area.

### Explanation of Coordinates and Angles
- **door_x, door_y:** Coordinates directly in front of the automatic sliding doors.
- **sensor_x, sensor_y:** Coordinates of the sensor located on the top right corner of the door frame.
- **reception_x, reception_y:** Coordinates of the reception area visible through the doors.
- **angle:** The specific angle required to face the sensor directly.

### Summary
The robot uses its movement and arm commands to approach the automatic sliding doors, ensuring it is detected by the sensor to trigger the doors to open. The robot then waits for the doors to open fully before proceeding through them to the reception area. This sequence of actions ensures that the task is completed efficiently and effectively.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the coordinates directly in front of the automatic sliding doors
move_to(door_x, door_y)

# Move the robot arm to the coordinates of the sensor
arm_move_to(sensor_x, sensor_y)

# Rotate the robot arm to face the sensor directly
arm_rotate(angle)

# Move one step closer to the door to trigger the sensor
move_to(door_x - 1, door_y)

# Wait for the doors to open fully
wait(2)

# Move through the now-open doors to the reception area
move_to(reception_x, reception_y)
```
