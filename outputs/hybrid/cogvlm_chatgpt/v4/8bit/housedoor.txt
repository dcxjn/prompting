=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases a closed door with a pale gray color. The door has a traditional design with four panels. Above the main door, there's a transom window with three smaller rectangular sections. The door is framed by white moldings, and there's a brass doorknob on the right side.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked?
- Do you have the key to the door?
- Do you know how to use the key to unlock the door?
- Is the doorknob easy to turn?
- Do you need to push or pull the door to open it?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?
- Is the door heavy or light to open?
- Are you strong enough to open the door by yourself?
- Is there a special way to open the door, like a secret button or code?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

No, the door is not locked. The door handle is visible and appears to be in its neutral position, indicating that the door is unlocked.
No, I do not have the key to the door.
No, I do not have the capability to use a key or any physical means to unlock the door. I am a robotic arm and do not have the physical attributes or permissions to interact with locks or doors in real life.
Based on the image, the doorknob appears to be a traditional round handle type, which typically is easy to turn. However, the actual ease of use would depend on factors such as the weight of the door, the quality of the hinge, and the distance from the user's hand.
Based on the image, the door handle is on the right side, which typically indicates that you would push the door to open it.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door from opening.
Based on the image, it's not possible to determine the weight of the door. However, the door's design, with its solid panels and sturdy frame, might suggest it's built to be durable and could potentially be heavy.
No, I am not strong enough to open the door by myself. The door appears to be too heavy for a robotic arm to lift.
Based on the image provided, there is no visible special mechanism or button on the door that would indicate a secret way to open it. The door appears to be a standard paneled door with a handle, which would typically be opened by turning the handle and using a key if locked.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself close to the door to interact with it. The coordinates `door_x` and `door_y` should be the location of the door.

2. **Move Arm to Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(doorknob_x, doorknob_y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned at the doorknob to interact with it. The coordinates `doorknob_x` and `doorknob_y` should be the location of the doorknob.

3. **Grab the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `grab(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to secure the doorknob to turn it.

4. **Rotate the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to turn the doorknob to open the latch. The `angle` should be sufficient to turn the doorknob fully (typically around 45-90 degrees).

5. **Push the Door:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door handle is on the right side, the door likely opens by pushing. The robot should push the door to open it.

6. **Release the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `release(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** After the door is pushed open, the robot can release the doorknob.

### Detailed Steps with Hypothetical Coordinates

Assuming the following coordinates:
- Door location: `(100, 50)`
- Doorknob location: `(105, 55)`

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(100, 50)`
   - **Reason:** Position the robot close to the door.

2. **Move Arm to Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(105, 55)`
   - **Reason:** Position the robot arm at the doorknob.

3. **Grab the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `grab(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** Secure the doorknob to turn it.

4. **Rotate the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(45)` (or `90` depending on the doorknob mechanism)
   - **Reason:** Turn the doorknob to open the latch.

5. **Push the Door:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** Open the door by pushing it.

6. **Release the Doorknob:**
   - **Command:** `release(doorknob)`
   - **Reason:** Let go of the doorknob after the door is open.

By following these steps, the robot should be able to open the door effectively.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door location
move_to(100, 50)

# Move the robot arm to the doorknob location
arm_move_to(105, 55)

# Grab the doorknob
grab(doorknob)

# Rotate the doorknob to open the latch
arm_rotate(45)  # or arm_rotate(90) depending on the mechanism

# Push the door to open it
push(door)

# Release the doorknob
release(doorknob)
```
