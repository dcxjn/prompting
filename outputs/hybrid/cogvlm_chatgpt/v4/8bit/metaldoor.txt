=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases a stainless steel door with a small rectangular window. The door is mounted on a white wall, and there's a silver-colored door stopper placed in front of it. The floor appears to be made of concrete.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- Where is the door handle or knob?
- Do I need a key to open the door?
- How do I turn the handle or knob to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?
- Do I need to move the door stopper before opening the door?
- Which way does the door open, inward or outward?
- Is there a button or switch I need to press to open the door?
- Is it safe to open the door right now?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door appears to be locked. There is no visible handle or keyhole on the visible side of the door, and there is no indication of a handle or key inserted into the door. Additionally, there is a small red sign on the door, which could indicate a locked status or a warning.
The door handle or knob is located on the right side of the door, just below the window.
Based on the image, there is no visible keyhole or lock mechanism on the door, which suggests that it might be a push-to-open or electronic door. Therefore, it's likely that you do not need a key to open the door.
To turn the handle or knob to open the door, you would typically follow these steps:
             1. Locate the handle or knob on the right side of the door.
             2. Grasp the handle firmly with your fingers.
             3. Rotate the handle clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the door's orientation (hinge side).
             4. Continue turning until the door is fully open.
             If the door is locked, you may need to use a key or a code to unlock it before attempting to open it.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door from opening. The door appears to be free from any objects or debris that might prevent it from being opened.
No, you do not need to move the door stopper before opening the door. The door stopper is in its retracted position, indicating that the door is currently unlocked and can be opened.
The door opens inward. This can be determined by the positioning of the door's handle on the right side, which is a common configuration for right-handed doors. When the handle is on the right, it's typically used to pull the door towards the inside of the room.
Based on the image provided, there is no visible button or switch on the door that would be necessary to open it. The door appears to be a push or pull type, which means it would likely open when pushed or pulled.
Based on the image, it appears that the door is equipped with a horizontal bar or handle on the right side, which suggests it can be opened manually. However, there is no visible lock or security mechanism on the door, which might imply that it is not locked. If this is indeed the case, it would be safe to open the door right now. However, it's always recommended to check for any signs of damage or security measures before opening any door, especially in a setting like this.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself close to the door to interact with the handle. The exact coordinates (x, y) should be determined based on the robot's current position and the door's location.

2. **Move Arm to Handle**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(x, y)`
   - **Reason:** The robot arm needs to be positioned near the door handle to grasp it. The coordinates (x, y) should correspond to the location of the handle on the right side of the door, just below the window.

3. **Grab the Handle**
   - **Command:** `grab(handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to securely grasp the handle to turn it. This ensures that the robot can apply the necessary force to rotate the handle.

4. **Rotate the Handle**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to rotate the handle to unlock the door. The angle of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) should be determined based on the door's orientation. Typically, a 90-degree rotation is sufficient.
   - **Example:** `arm_rotate(90)` or `arm_rotate(-90)`

5. **Pull the Door**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door opens inward, the robot needs to pull the door towards itself to open it. This step assumes the handle has been successfully rotated to unlock the door.

6. **Release the Handle**
   - **Command:** `release(handle)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can release the handle to complete the task.

### Detailed Steps with Commands

1. **Move to the Door:**
   - `move_to(door_x, door_y)`
   - **Reason:** Position the robot close to the door.

2. **Move Arm to Handle:**
   - `arm_move_to(handle_x, handle_y)`
   - **Reason:** Position the robot arm near the handle.

3. **Grab the Handle:**
   - `grab(handle)`
   - **Reason:** Securely grasp the handle.

4. **Rotate the Handle:**
   - `arm_rotate(90)` (or `arm_rotate(-90)`)
   - **Reason:** Rotate the handle to unlock the door.

5. **Pull the Door:**
   - `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** Open the door by pulling it inward.

6. **Release the Handle:**
   - `release(handle)`
   - **Reason:** Complete the task by releasing the handle.

### Assumptions and Considerations
- The exact coordinates (x, y) for `move_to` and `arm_move_to` commands should be determined based on the robot's initial position and the door's location.
- The angle for `arm_rotate` should be adjusted based on the door's specific handle mechanism.
- Ensure that the robot's sensors confirm the door is unlocked before attempting to pull it open.
- Safety checks should be in place to avoid any damage to the door or the robot.
