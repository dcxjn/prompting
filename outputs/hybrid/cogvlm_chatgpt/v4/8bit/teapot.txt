=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Get the Teapot

1. **Identify the Teapot's Position:**
   - **Reason:** To ensure the robot knows the exact location of the teapot on the table.
   - The teapot is on the left side of the table, next to a wine glass on the left and a wine bottle on the right.

2. **Move the Robot Body to the Table:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(table_x, table_y)`
   - **Reason:** To position the robot close enough to the table to reach the teapot.

3. **Move the Robot Arm to the Teapot's Position:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y)`
   - **Reason:** To align the robot arm directly above the teapot for accurate grabbing.

4. **Adjust the Arm's Angle if Necessary:**
   - **Command:** `arm_rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** To ensure the arm is in the correct orientation to grab the teapot's handle.

5. **Grab the Teapot:**
   - **Command:** `grab(teapot)`
   - **Reason:** To securely hold the teapot with the robot arm.

6. **Lift the Teapot:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(teapot_x, teapot_y + lift_height)`
   - **Reason:** To lift the teapot off the table without disturbing other items.

7. **Move the Robot Arm Back to a Safe Position:**
   - **Command:** `arm_move_to(safe_x, safe_y)`
   - **Reason:** To move the teapot to a safe location where it can be easily accessed or placed down.

### Example Coordinates and Commands (Assuming Coordinates)
- `table_x, table_y` = (100, 50)
- `teapot_x, teapot_y` = (90, 45)
- `lift_height` = 10
- `safe_x, safe_y` = (110, 60)

### Commands Sequence
1. `move_to(100, 50)`
2. `arm_move_to(90, 45)`
3. `arm_rotate(0)` (if needed)
4. `grab(teapot)`
5. `arm_move_to(90, 55)` (lifting the teapot)
6. `arm_move_to(110, 60)`

### Reasons for Each Step
- **Step 1:** Position the robot close to the table to reach the teapot.
- **Step 2:** Align the robot arm directly above the teapot.
- **Step 3:** Ensure the arm is correctly oriented to grab the teapot.
- **Step 4:** Securely hold the teapot.
- **Step 5:** Lift the teapot to avoid knocking over other items.
- **Step 6:** Move the teapot to a safe location for further actions.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully complete the task of getting the teapot.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move the robot to the table
move_to(100, 50)

# Move the robot arm to the teapot's position
arm_move_to(90, 45)

# Adjust the arm's angle if necessary
arm_rotate(0)  # Assuming no rotation needed

# Grab the teapot
grab(teapot)

# Lift the teapot
arm_move_to(90, 55)

# Move the teapot to a safe position
arm_move_to(110, 60)
```
