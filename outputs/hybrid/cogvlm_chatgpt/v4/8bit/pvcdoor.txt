=== IMAGE DESC ===

The image showcases an interior space, possibly a living room or hallway. On the left, there's a framed artwork of a dreamcatcher hanging on the wall. Below it, there's a wooden cabinet or sideboard with a few decorative items on top. To the right, there's a white folding door that's partially open, revealing another room with a wooden door and a warm, ambient light.

=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Which door should I open, the white folding door or the wooden door in the other room?
- Is the white folding door easy to open, or does it need a special way to open it?
- Do I need to be careful of anything when opening the white folding door?
- Is there anything behind the white folding door that I should know about before opening it?
- Should I open the white folding door all the way or just a little bit?
- Is there anyone or anything in the other room that I should be aware of before opening the door?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

You should open the white folding door.
The white folding door appears to be easy to open. It is a standard accordion-style door that can be opened by simply pushing the panels together. There are no visible handles or special mechanisms in the image that would suggest it needs a special way to open.
Yes, you should be careful when opening the white folding door. The door is partially open, and you may need to push it gently to allow it to fully open without causing any obstruction or injury.
Based on the image provided, there doesn't appear to be any objects or individuals immediately behind the white folding door that would require attention before opening it. The room beyond the door seems to be a hallway with a closed door at the end, and the floor is clean and unobstructed. Therefore, it seems safe to proceed with opening the door without any immediate concerns.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the White Folding Door

1. **move_to(0, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Start by positioning the robot at the initial coordinates, assuming (0, 0) is the starting point where the viewer is located.

2. **arm_move_to(1, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot arm to the coordinates where the white folding door is located. This assumes the door is slightly to the right of the robot's initial position.

3. **arm_rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robot arm to align it parallel to the door panels, making it easier to push the panels together.

4. **push(door_panel)**
   - **Reason:** Gently push the door panel to start opening the white folding door. Since the door is partially open, a gentle push should suffice.

5. **arm_move_to(1.5, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot arm slightly further along the door panel to continue pushing it open. This ensures the door opens smoothly without causing any obstruction.

6. **push(door_panel)**
   - **Reason:** Continue pushing the door panel to open the door just a little bit more, as specified in the instructions.

7. **arm_move_to(2, 0)**
   - **Reason:** Move the robot arm to the final position to ensure the door is adequately open.

8. **push(door_panel)**
   - **Reason:** Give a final gentle push to ensure the door is open just a little bit, as required.

9. **arm_rotate(-90)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robot arm back to its original position to avoid any obstruction or injury.

10. **move_to(0, 0)**
    - **Reason:** Return the robot to its initial position, completing the task.

### Summary of Steps and Reasons
- The robot starts at the viewer's position and moves its arm to the door.
- The arm is rotated to align with the door panels for effective pushing.
- The robot gently pushes the door panels in small increments to open the door just a little bit.
- The arm is rotated back to its original position to avoid any obstruction.
- The robot returns to its initial position, completing the task safely and efficiently.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Step 1: Move to initial position
move_to(0, 0)  # Start at (0, 0)

# Step 2: Move arm to door location
arm_move_to(1, 0)  # Move arm to (1, 0)

# Step 3: Rotate arm to align with door
arm_rotate(90)  # Rotate arm 90 degrees

# Step 4: Push door panel
push(door_panel)  # Push door panel

# Step 5: Move arm further along door panel
arm_move_to(1.5, 0)  # Move arm to (1.5, 0)

# Step 6: Continue pushing door panel
push(door_panel)  # Push door panel

# Step 7: Move arm to final position
arm_move_to(2, 0)  # Move arm to (2, 0)

# Step 8: Final push to open door
push(door_panel)  # Push door panel

# Step 9: Rotate arm back to original position
arm_rotate(-90)  # Rotate arm -90 degrees

# Step 10: Return to initial position
move_to(0, 0)  # Return to (0, 0)
```
