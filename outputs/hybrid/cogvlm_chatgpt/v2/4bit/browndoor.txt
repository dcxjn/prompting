=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help gather the information needed to open the door using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the door located? (Please provide the exact x and y coordinates.)
2. Is the door handle a knob or a lever?
3. Where is the door handle located on the door? (Please provide the exact x and y coordinates.)
4. Which direction does the door open? (Does it push inwards or pull outwards?)
5. If the door handle is a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door? (Please provide the angle in degrees.)
6. If the door handle is a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up to open the door?
7. Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?
8. How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?
9. Is the door locked? If so, where is the keyhole located? (Please provide the exact x and y coordinates.)
10. If the door is locked, do I need to turn the key to unlock it? (Please provide the angle in degrees.)

These questions should help gather all the necessary details to successfully open the door using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To answer your questions, I will provide the specific coordinates and details for the door in the image:

1. **Where is the door located?**
   - The door is located at the coordinates: x= 0.5 m, y= 1.8 m.

2. **Is the door handle a knob or a lever?**
   - The door handle is a knob.

3. **Where is the door handle located on the door?**
   - The door handle is located at the coordinates: x= 0.9 m, y= 1.6 m.

4. **Which direction does the door open?**
   - The door opens inwards.

5. **If the door handle is a knob, how much do I need to rotate it to open the door?**
   - To open the door, you would need to rotate the knob approximately 90 degrees in the direction facing the door handle.

6. **If the door handle is a lever, do I need to push it down or pull it up to open the door?**
   - Since the door handle is a knob, there is no lever mechanism to push or pull. Instead, you would rotate the knob as mentioned in question 5.

7. **Is there any object blocking the door that needs to be moved first?**
   - From the image provided, there does not appear to be any object blocking the door that needs to be moved before opening it.

8. **How much force is needed to push or pull the door open?**
   - The image does not provide enough detail to accurately determine the amount of force needed to open the door. It would be best to refer to the door's specifications or consult with a professional for this information.

9. **Is the door locked? If so, where is the keyhole located?**
   - From the image, it is not possible to determine if the door is locked or where the keyhole is located. You would need to physically inspect the door or have more information to answer this question.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Based on the provided answers and the available robot commands, here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how the robot would complete the task of opening the door:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.9, 1.6)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself at the door handle to interact with it.

2. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to secure a grip on the door handle to rotate it.

3. **Rotate the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a knob that needs to be rotated 90 degrees to unlock the door mechanism.

4. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** After rotating the knob, the robot needs to release the handle to proceed to the next step.

5. **Move to the Door:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 1.8)`
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself at the door to push it open.

6. **Push the Door:**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** The door opens inwards, so the robot needs to push it to open it.

### Summary of Commands
1. `move_to(0.9, 1.6)`
2. `grab(door_handle)`
3. `rotate(90)`
4. `release(door_handle)`
5. `move_to(0.5, 1.8)`
6. `push(door)`

### Reasons for Each Step
- **Step 1:** The robot must be at the correct position to interact with the door handle.
- **Step 2:** Grabbing the handle ensures the robot can apply the necessary force to rotate it.
- **Step 3:** Rotating the knob unlocks the door mechanism.
- **Step 4:** Releasing the handle allows the robot to reposition itself for the next action.
- **Step 5:** Moving to the door ensures the robot is in the correct position to push it open.
- **Step 6:** Pushing the door completes the task of opening it.

By following these steps, the robot should be able to successfully open the door.
