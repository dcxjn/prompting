=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

Sure! Here are some very specific questions to help us get the teapot using the robotic arm:

1. Where is the teapot right now? Can you tell me the exact spot (x, y) where it is?
2. Is the teapot on a table, a shelf, or somewhere else?
3. Is there anything blocking the way to the teapot that we need to move first?
4. What does the teapot look like? Is it big or small?
5. Can the teapot be grabbed easily, or is it too heavy or slippery?
6. Do we need to rotate the teapot to grab it properly? If yes, by how many degrees?
7. After grabbing the teapot, where should we put it down? Can you tell me the exact spot (x, y) for that?
8. Is there anything fragile near the teapot that we need to be careful about?
9. Should we push or pull the teapot to get it into a better position before grabbing it?
10. Is there a specific way to hold the teapot to avoid spilling anything inside it?

These questions will help us understand exactly what we need to do to get the teapot using the robotic arm.

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

1. The teapot is on a table, and its exact spot is at coordinates (x, y) = (0, 0) on the table.
2. No, there is nothing blocking the way to the teapot.
3. The teapot appears to be of a medium size.
4. The teapot does not look too heavy or slippery; however, without tactile feedback, it's hard to say for certain.
5. The teapot appears to be made of ceramic or porcelain, which might make it fragile.
6. The teapot does not need to be rotated; it's facing the robotic arm directly.
7. The robotic arm should be positioned to grab the teapot from the left side, at coordinates (x, y) = (-0.5, 0).
8. The robotic arm should be prepared to pull the teapot out from the table.
9. There is no specific way to hold the teapot to avoid spilling; however, it's advisable to grip it firmly.
10. The robotic arm should aim to pull the teapot out from the left side, moving it slightly upward to clear any obstacles or other items on the table.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to get the teapot, along with reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the teapot's position:**
   ```python
   move_to(0, 0)
   ```
   *Reason:* The teapot is located at coordinates (0, 0) on the table, so the robotic arm needs to move to this position to interact with it.

2. **Position the arm to grab the teapot from the left side:**
   ```python
   move_to(-0.5, 0)
   ```
   *Reason:* The teapot should be grabbed from the left side, so the arm needs to be positioned slightly to the left of the teapot.

3. **Grab the teapot:**
   ```python
   grab(teapot)
   ```
   *Reason:* The arm needs to securely hold the teapot to move it.

4. **Lift the teapot slightly upward:**
   ```python
   move_to(-0.5, 0.5)
   ```
   *Reason:* Lifting the teapot slightly upward ensures it clears any obstacles or other items on the table.

5. **Pull the teapot out from the table:**
   ```python
   pull(teapot)
   ```
   *Reason:* Pulling the teapot out ensures it is safely removed from the table without knocking over any other items.

6. **Move the teapot to the desired location:**
   ```python
   move_to(desired_x, desired_y)
   ```
   *Reason:* The teapot needs to be moved to a new location. Replace `desired_x` and `desired_y` with the actual coordinates of the new location.

7. **Release the teapot:**
   ```python
   release(teapot)
   ```
   *Reason:* The robotic arm needs to let go of the teapot once it has been moved to the desired location.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully get the teapot and move it to the desired location.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the teapot's position
move_to(0, 0)

# Position the arm to grab the teapot from the left side
move_to(-0.5, 0)

# Grab the teapot
grab(teapot)

# Lift the teapot slightly upward
move_to(-0.5, 0.5)

# Pull the teapot out from the table
pull(teapot)

# Move the teapot to the desired location
move_to(desired_x, desired_y)

# Release the teapot
release(teapot)
```
