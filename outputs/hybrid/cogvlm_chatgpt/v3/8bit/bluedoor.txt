=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- Is the door locked? If yes, where is the key or how do I unlock it?
- What is the angle I need to rotate the handle to open the door?
- Are there any obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm?
- How wide does the door open? (What is the angle or distance the door moves when it is fully open?)

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0).
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 3 feet above the ground.
The door handle in the image is a knob.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a push door. There is no visible handle or doorknob on the side facing you, which is typical for push doors.
Based on the image, the door appears to be a standard wooden door with a metal handle and lock. Typically, such doors require a moderate amount of force to open, similar to pushing against a closed door. However, the exact force needed would depend on the door's weight, the quality of the hardware, and the door's age. It's advisable to approach with a gentle push and use the handle for leverage if necessary.
Based on the image provided, the door appears to be locked. There is a doorknob on the door, but no visible keyhole or key. To unlock it, you would typically need a key or a code to operate the lock mechanism. If there's a code, you would enter it into the lock's keypad or use a remote control. If it's a deadbolt, you might need to use a key to turn the handle and then insert the key into the keyhole to unlock the door.
The door handle is located at the top center of the door, and it appears to be a horizontal bar-style handle. Typically, such handles are turned to the right to open the door. Therefore, you would need to rotate the handle to the right to open the door.
No, there are no obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm. The path is clear.
The door appears to be a standard hinged door, which typically opens at a 90-degree angle. When fully opened, it would move a distance equal to its width. Without specific measurements, it's hard to give an exact distance, but it would be approximately the width of the door itself.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **move_to(0, 3)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is located at the coordinates (0, 0) and is 3 feet above the ground. Moving to (0, 3) positions the robotic arm at the height of the door handle.

2. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a knob that needs to be turned to the right to unlock the door. Rotating the handle 90 degrees to the right should unlock it.

3. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** The door is a push door. After unlocking the door by turning the knob, the robot needs to push the door to open it.

4. **move_to(0, 0)**
   - **Reason:** After pushing the door, the robot should return to its initial position to avoid any potential obstacles or to be ready for the next command.

By following these steps, the robot should be able to successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle height
move_to(0, 3)

# Rotate the handle to unlock the door
rotate(90)

# Push the door to open it
push(door)

# Return to the initial position
move_to(0, 0)
```
