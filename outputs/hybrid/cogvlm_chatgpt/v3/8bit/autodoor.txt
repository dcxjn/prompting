=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What angle do I need to rotate the handle to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the bottom of the image. The x-coordinate is 0 (the left edge of the image), and the y-coordinate is 0 (the bottom edge of the image).
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 36 inches from the ground.
The door handle in the image is a lever.
You do not need to push or pull the door to open it. It is an automatic sliding door.
The door appears to be an automatic sliding door, which typically operates using an electric motor and control system. The force needed to open it would depend on the motor's power and the door's weight. However, without specific details or measurements, it's not possible to determine the exact force required.
The door is an automatic sliding door, and there is no visible handle to manually open or close it. You would need to use the electronic control panel located on the wall to the left of the door to operate it.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door that needs to be moved first. The door appears to be clear and ready to slide open.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robot to Open the Automatic Sliding Door

1. **Identify the Control Panel Location**
   - **Reason:** The door is automatic and requires the control panel to be activated to open.

2. **Move to the Control Panel**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)`
   - **Example:** `move_to(-10, 36)`
   - **Reason:** The control panel is located on the wall to the left of the door, approximately 36 inches from the ground. The robot needs to position itself in front of the control panel to interact with it.

3. **Activate the Control Panel**
   - **Command:** `push(control_panel)`
   - **Reason:** The control panel likely has a button or sensor that needs to be activated to open the door. The robot will push the button to trigger the door mechanism.

4. **Wait for the Door to Open**
   - **Reason:** After activating the control panel, the robot should wait for the door to slide open completely before proceeding.

5. **Move Through the Doorway**
   - **Command:** `move_to(x, y)`
   - **Example:** `move_to(0, 0)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can move through the doorway to complete the task.

### Detailed Steps with Commands

1. **Move to the Control Panel**
   - `move_to(-10, 36)`
   - **Reason:** Position the robot in front of the control panel to interact with it.

2. **Push the Control Panel Button**
   - `push(control_panel)`
   - **Reason:** Activate the door mechanism to open the automatic sliding door.

3. **Wait for the Door to Open**
   - **Reason:** Ensure the door is fully open before moving through to avoid any collision.

4. **Move Through the Doorway**
   - `move_to(0, 0)`
   - **Reason:** Complete the task by moving through the now open doorway.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the automatic sliding door and move through it.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the Control Panel
move_to(-10, 36)  # Position the robot in front of the control panel

# Push the Control Panel Button
push(control_panel)  # Activate the door mechanism

# Wait for the Door to Open
# (Assume there's an implicit wait or a function to check the door status)

# Move Through the Doorway
move_to(0, 0)  # Move through the now open doorway
```
