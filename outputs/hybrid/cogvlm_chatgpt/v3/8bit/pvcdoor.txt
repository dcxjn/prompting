=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
- What type of door handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
- What angle should the robotic arm rotate to turn the door handle?
- After turning the handle, should the door be pushed or pulled to open it?
- How far should the door be opened? (What is the distance the door needs to move?)
- Are there any obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the following coordinates:
             x: 0.5 (halfway from the left edge of the image)
             y: 0.5 (halfway from the bottom edge of the image)
No, the door handle is not within reach of the robotic arm. The arm is positioned to the left of the door, and the handle is on the right side of the door.
The door has a lever handle.
The door opens towards you.
The door appears to be locked. There is no visible handle or keyhole on the visible side of the door, and the door is closed.
The door handle appears to be a standard interior door handle, typically requiring a moderate amount of force to turn. Depending on the door's weight and the quality of the hardware, it might require anywhere from 5 to 20 pounds of force to turn fully. However, without specific measurements or additional context, this is a general estimate.
To turn the door handle, the robotic arm should rotate inwards at an angle that allows it to reach the horizontal bar of the door handle. The exact angle would depend on the door handle's height and position relative to the arm's reach.
The door should be pushed to open it.
To determine the distance the door needs to move, we need to observe the current position of the door and the space it covers. The door is currently closed, and we can see the interior of the room through the door's opening. The visible space inside the room is approximately 2.5 meters in width and 3 meters in height. If we assume the door is a standard width of 2.1 meters, then the door would need to be opened by approximately 0.9 meters to reveal the entire space inside.
No, there are no obstacles in the way of the door or the robotic arm. The space appears to be clear and unobstructed.

### Step-by-Step Guide for the Robotic Arm to Open the Door

1. **Move to the Door Handle's Position**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.5, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door is located at coordinates (0.5, 0.5), so the robotic arm needs to move to this position to interact with the door handle.

2. **Extend the Arm to Reach the Handle**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.6, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** Since the handle is on the right side of the door and the arm is positioned to the left, the arm needs to extend slightly to the right to reach the handle.

3. **Rotate the Arm to Align with the Lever Handle**
   - **Command:** `rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** The exact angle depends on the arm's current orientation, but it needs to rotate inward to align with the horizontal bar of the lever handle.

4. **Grab the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `grab(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** The arm needs to securely grab the lever handle to turn it.

5. **Turn the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `rotate(angle)`
   - **Reason:** Rotate the handle to unlock the door. The angle will depend on the handle's design, but typically a 90-degree turn is required.

6. **Push the Door to Open It**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** The door opens towards the viewer, so the arm needs to push the door to open it.

7. **Move the Arm Back to Avoid Obstruction**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.4, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** After pushing the door, the arm should move back slightly to avoid being in the way of the opening door.

8. **Push the Door Further to Fully Open It**
   - **Command:** `push(door)`
   - **Reason:** Continue pushing the door until it is fully open, approximately 0.9 meters.

9. **Release the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `release(door_handle)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is fully open, the arm can release the handle.

10. **Move Back to Initial Position**
    - **Command:** `move_to(initial_position)`
    - **Reason:** Return the arm to its initial position to be ready for the next task.

### Summary
- The robotic arm moves to the door's position, extends to reach the handle, rotates to align with the lever, grabs and turns the handle, pushes the door open, and then returns to its initial position. Each step is designed to ensure the arm can effectively interact with the door and handle without obstruction.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door handle's position
move_to(0.5, 0.5)  # Position arm at door coordinates

# Extend the arm to reach the handle
move_to(0.6, 0.5)  # Extend arm to the right

# Rotate the arm to align with the lever handle
rotate(angle)  # Align with horizontal bar of lever handle

# Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)  # Securely grab the lever handle

# Turn the door handle
rotate(angle)  # Rotate handle to unlock door (typically 90 degrees)

# Push the door to open it
push(door)  # Push door to start opening

# Move the arm back to avoid obstruction
move_to(0.4, 0.5)  # Move back slightly

# Push the door further to fully open it
push(door)  # Continue pushing door until fully open (approx. 0.9 meters)

# Release the door handle
release(door_handle)  # Release handle once door is fully open

# Move back to initial position
move_to(initial_position)  # Return to initial position
```
