=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
- What type of door handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
- What is the angle needed to rotate the door handle to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door from opening?
- How far does the door need to be pushed or pulled to open fully?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0) on the image. This is because the door is the central element in the image and is positioned at the center of the frame.
Based on the image provided, the robotic arm does not appear to be within reach of the door handle. The arm is positioned to the left of the door, and the handle is located on the right side. The arm's end effector, which is the tool or gripper, is not visible in the image, so it's unclear if it's equipped to reach the handle.
The door has a knob handle. It appears to be a round, flat-topped knob without any visible lever mechanism.
The door appears to open towards you, as the handle is on the right side when facing the door.
The door appears to be locked, as there is no visible handle or keyhole that would indicate it is unlocked.
The image does not provide enough information to accurately determine the amount of force needed to turn the door handle. Factors such as the door's weight, the handle's material, and its design would influence this. However, typically, standard interior door handles require a moderate amount of force, similar to what one might use to open a closed door.
To determine the angle needed to rotate the door handle to open the door, we would need to know the orientation of the door's hinge and its position relative to the door frame. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately calculate the angle. Typically, door handles are mounted perpendicular to the door's edge, but this can vary based on the door's design and the hinge's placement.
No, there is nothing blocking the door from opening. It appears to be free from obstructions.
To determine the exact distance the door needs to be pushed or pulled to open fully, one would need to measure the width of the door and the space between the door's edge and the wall on either side. Subtracting the width of the door from the total space between the door's edge and the wall will give the required distance.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, considering the given answers and available commands:

1. **Move to the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0, 0)`
   - **Reason:** The door is located at the coordinates (0, 0), so the robotic arm needs to move to this position to interact with the door handle.

2. **Rotate to Align with the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door handle is a knob and the arm is positioned to the left of the door, rotating the arm by 90 degrees will align the end effector with the knob handle.

3. **Move to the Door Handle's Position**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0, -1)`
   - **Reason:** The handle is on the right side of the door when facing it, so the arm needs to move slightly to the right to reach the handle.

4. **Grab the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `grab(knob)`
   - **Reason:** The arm needs to grab the knob handle to turn it and open the door.

5. **Rotate the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `rotate(45)`
   - **Reason:** Typically, door knobs require a 45-degree turn to unlock. This angle may vary, but 45 degrees is a reasonable estimate.

6. **Pull the Door to Open**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** The door opens towards the viewer, so the arm needs to pull the door after turning the knob.

7. **Move Back to Allow Door to Open Fully**
   - **Command:** `move_to(-1, 0)`
   - **Reason:** Moving back slightly will ensure that the door has enough space to open fully without the arm obstructing it.

8. **Release the Door Handle**
   - **Command:** `release(knob)`
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the arm can release the knob handle.

By following these steps, the robotic arm should be able to open the door effectively. Each step is designed to ensure the arm interacts correctly with the door handle and opens the door without any obstructions.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Move to the door's initial position
move_to(0, 0)

# Rotate to align with the door handle
rotate(90)

# Move to the door handle's position
move_to(0, -1)

# Grab the door handle
grab(knob)

# Rotate the door handle to unlock
rotate(45)

# Pull the door to open
pull(door)

# Move back to allow the door to open fully
move_to(-1, 0)

# Release the door handle
release(knob)
```
