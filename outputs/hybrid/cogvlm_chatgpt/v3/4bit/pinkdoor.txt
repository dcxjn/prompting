=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle on the left or right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What type of door handle is it? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Does the door open by pushing or pulling?
- How much force is needed to open the door?
- What is the angle to rotate the handle to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door that needs to be moved first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the coordinates (0.5, 0.5), where the x-coordinate is 0.5 (or 50% of the image width) and the y-coordinate is also 0.5 (or 50% of the image height), indicating that the door is centrally positioned in the image.
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
 The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet from the ground.
The door handle in the image appears to be a knob. It is round and lacks the extended arm typical of a lever.
The door appears to open by pulling, as evidenced by the handle's placement on the right side, which is typical for right-handed doors.
The door appears to be a standard interior door, which typically requires a moderate amount of force to open. Depending on its weight and the type of hinge used, one might need to apply a force of around 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kg) of force at an angle, using a door handle or doorknob. However, without knowing the exact weight and mechanism of the door, this is a general estimate.
The handle on the door is located on the right side when facing it. To open the door, one would typically rotate the handle clockwise.
No, there is no visible obstruction blocking the door that needs to be moved first.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** The door is centrally positioned in the image at coordinates (0.5, 0.5). Moving to this position ensures the robot is directly in front of the door.

2. **move_to(0.5, 2.5)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is approximately 2.5 feet from the ground. Moving to this height ensures the robot's arm is aligned with the door handle.

3. **grab(knob)**
   - **Reason:** The door handle is a knob. The robot needs to grab the knob to rotate it and open the door.

4. **rotate(90)**
   - **Reason:** The handle needs to be rotated clockwise to open the door. A 90-degree rotation is typically sufficient to unlatch the door.

5. **pull(knob)**
   - **Reason:** The door opens by pulling. The robot needs to pull the knob to open the door.

6. **release(knob)**
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot can release the knob.

7. **move_to(0.5, 0.5)**
   - **Reason:** Moving back to the central position ensures the robot is not obstructing the open door and is ready for any further commands.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
move_to(0.5, 0.5)  # Move to the central position in front of the door
move_to(0.5, 2.5)  # Align with the door handle height
grab(knob)         # Grab the door knob
rotate(90)         # Rotate the knob 90 degrees clockwise
pull(knob)         # Pull the knob to open the door
release(knob)      # Release the knob
move_to(0.5, 0.5)  # Return to the central position
```
