=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? (What are the x and y coordinates of the door?)
- Is the door handle within reach of the robotic arm?
- What type of handle does the door have? (Is it a knob, lever, or something else?)
- Which direction does the door open? (Does it open towards you or away from you?)
- Is the door locked or unlocked?
- If the door is locked, where is the key located?
- How much force is needed to turn the handle or push/pull the door?
- What is the angle of rotation needed to turn the handle?
- Are there any obstacles between the robotic arm and the door?
- Is there anything the robotic arm needs to avoid while opening the door?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

The door is located at the following coordinates:
             x: 0.5 (halfway across the image from the left edge)
             y: 0.5 (halfway down the image from the top edge)
             The door is a large glass panel with a black frame, and it appears to be a part of a modern interior design.
Yes, the door handle is within reach of the robotic arm. It is located on the right side of the door, and the arm's end appears to be positioned to grasp or interact with it.
The door has a lever handle.
The door appears to open towards you. This is inferred from the positioning of the door handle on the right side, which is typically on the inside of the door for easy access from the inside room.
The door appears to be locked. There is no visible handle or keyhole on the door's surface, and there is no visible key or handle in the reflection.
The key is located on the right side of the door, attached to the door handle.
The force needed to turn the handle or push/pull the door would depend on the weight of the door and the resistance of the door's mechanism. However, given the modern design and the sleek appearance of the door, it is likely that the door is equipped with a concealed mechanism, which would require a moderate amount of force. It's essential to note that without knowing the exact weight and mechanism details, it's challenging to provide an accurate estimation.
To turn the handle on the door, you would need to rotate the robotic arm approximately 90 degrees clockwise.
Yes, there is an object on the floor between the robotic arm and the door, which could be considered an obstacle.
Yes, the robotic arm should avoid the black power cord on the floor to prevent any tripping hazards or potential damage to the cord.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Certainly! Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robotic arm to open the door, along with the reasons for each step:

1. **Move to the Key Location:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.55, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The key is located on the right side of the door, attached to the door handle. Moving to these coordinates positions the robotic arm near the key.

2. **Grab the Key:**
   - **Command:** `grab(key)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to grab the key to unlock the door.

3. **Rotate the Key to Unlock the Door:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** Rotate the key 90 degrees clockwise to unlock the door.

4. **Release the Key:**
   - **Command:** `release(key)`
   - **Reason:** The key is no longer needed once the door is unlocked.

5. **Move to the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `move_to(0.55, 0.5)`
   - **Reason:** The door handle is on the right side of the door. Moving to these coordinates positions the robotic arm near the handle.

6. **Grab the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `grab(handle)`
   - **Reason:** The robotic arm needs to grab the handle to open the door.

7. **Rotate the Handle:**
   - **Command:** `rotate(90)`
   - **Reason:** Rotate the handle 90 degrees clockwise to unlatch the door.

8. **Pull the Door:**
   - **Command:** `pull(door)`
   - **Reason:** Since the door opens towards the viewer, the robotic arm needs to pull the door to open it.

9. **Release the Door Handle:**
   - **Command:** `release(handle)`
   - **Reason:** The door is now open, and the handle is no longer needed.

10. **Move Back to Avoid Obstacles:**
    - **Command:** `move_to(0.45, 0.5)`
    - **Reason:** Move back slightly to avoid the object on the floor and the black power cord, ensuring the robotic arm does not trip or damage anything.

By following these steps, the robotic arm will successfully open the door while avoiding obstacles and ensuring safety.
