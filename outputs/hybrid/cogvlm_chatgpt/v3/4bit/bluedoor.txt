=== RELEVANT QUESTIONS ===

- Where is the door located? Can you give me the exact x and y coordinates?
- Is the door handle on the left side or the right side of the door?
- What is the height of the door handle from the ground?
- What kind of door handle is it? Is it a knob, a lever, or something else?
- Do I need to push or pull the door to open it?
- How much force is needed to turn the door handle?
- What angle do I need to rotate the handle to open the door?
- Is there anything blocking the door that I need to move first?

=== IMAGE FEATURES ===

To provide the exact x and y coordinates for the door, I would need a reference system or grid to work from. However, in this image, there is no visible grid or reference points to determine the exact coordinates of the door. If you have a specific grid or reference system in mind, please provide that information, and I can assist you with the coordinates.
The door handle is on the right side of the door.
The door handle is approximately 3 feet from the ground.
The door handle in the image appears to be a knob. It is round and sits centrally on the door, which is typical of knobs. Knobs are often used for their simplicity and ease of use, requiring no turning or pulling action.
Based on the image, it's not explicitly clear whether the door opens by pushing or pulling. However, most doors are designed to be pushed open from the inside. If you notice a handle on the outside, it typically indicates a pull mechanism. If there's no visible handle or mechanism, it's likely a push door.
The image does not provide enough information to accurately determine the amount of force needed to turn the door handle. Factors such as the door's weight, the handle's material, and its design would influence this. It would be best to physically test or refer to the manufacturer's specifications for precise information.
To open the door, you would typically rotate the handle clockwise. However, the exact angle might vary depending on the door's mechanism and the handle's design. It's always a good idea to check the door's lock or handle label for specific instructions.
Based on the image provided, there doesn't appear to be anything blocking the door. The entrance looks clear and inviting.

=== ROBOT INSTRUCTIONS ===

Sure, here is a detailed step-by-step guide for the robot to open the door, along with reasons for each step:

1. **move_to(x, y)**
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to position itself in front of the door handle to interact with it. Since exact coordinates are not provided, assume the robot moves to a position directly in front of the door handle, approximately 3 feet from the ground and aligned with the right side of the door.

2. **move_to(x, y + 3 feet)**
   - **Reason:** Adjust the robot's arm to the height of the door handle, which is 3 feet from the ground.

3. **rotate(angle)**
   - **Reason:** Rotate the robotic arm to align with the door handle. Since the handle is a knob, the robot needs to position its gripper to grasp the knob properly. The exact angle will depend on the robot's initial orientation.

4. **grab(door handle)**
   - **Reason:** The robot needs to grab the door handle to turn it. This command ensures the robot has a firm grip on the knob.

5. **rotate(clockwise)**
   - **Reason:** Turn the door handle clockwise to unlock or open the door. The exact angle of rotation might vary, but typically a 90-degree turn is sufficient for most door knobs.

6. **move_to(x, y - 3 feet)**
   - **Reason:** After turning the knob, the robot needs to move its arm back to avoid obstructing the door's movement.

7. **push(door)**
   - **Reason:** Since the door is likely to be pushed open from the inside, the robot should push the door to open it. This command will apply the necessary force to move the door.

8. **release(door handle)**
   - **Reason:** Once the door is open, the robot should release the door handle to complete the task.

By following these steps, the robot will successfully open the door. Each step is designed to ensure the robot interacts with the door handle correctly and applies the necessary actions to open the door.

=== CODE SUMMARY ===

```python
# Step 1: Move to position in front of the door handle
move_to(x, y)

# Step 2: Adjust arm to the height of the door handle
move_to(x, y + 3)

# Step 3: Rotate arm to align with the door handle
rotate(angle)

# Step 4: Grab the door handle
grab(door_handle)

# Step 5: Turn the door handle clockwise
rotate(clockwise)

# Step 6: Move arm back to avoid obstructing the door
move_to(x, y - 3)

# Step 7: Push the door to open it
push(door)

# Step 8: Release the door handle
release(door_handle)
```
